The data of <a href="https://world.openfoodfacts.org">Open Food Facts</a> were already open and free (in <i>open data</i> as they say), and now they are also linked. And yes, free and linked at once!

免费是因为开放许可证允许所有人出于任何目的使用数据，而链接是因为数据现在不仅可以相互链接，还可以通过数据库 DBPedia 链接到其他数据集。<br>

让我重新表述一下：现在有一个大文件，其中包含有关产品、其成分和营养成分的 Open Food Facts 数据。 The products are related to the ingredients they contain, and the ingredients (some to start) refer to their page on <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/DBpedia">DBPedia</a> (a database from Wikipedia articles). This file is not for humans, but for programs. It is possible to query it, to formulate queries as "which are the products whose main ingredient is sugar", and to cross it easily with other datasets.

Thanks to this file, the OFF data is now part of what is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_data">"Linked Data" or "the Web of Data"</a> . The data is more easily reusable.

Will Open Food Facts data soon be linked with lots of other datasets?<br>

<h3><b>The technical details:<br>

我参加了 <a href="https://datalift.org/">Datalift</a> 的 Charles Nepote 邀请我的 <b>Datalift Camp</b> ，这是我第一次使用 Datalift 工具。 我们开始“玩” OFF(Open Food Facts) 数据，看看如何在 RDF 中表达它。<br>
<br>
The data on ingredients and nutrients are described by an <a href="https://data.lirmm.fr/ontologies/food">ontology food</a> that we are creating with <b>François Scharffe</b> of the Laboratory of Informatics, Robotics and Microelectronics of Montpellier <a href="https://www.lirmm.fr/">LIRMM</a> and <b>Emmanuel Nauer</b> of the Lorrain Laboratory of Research in Computer Science and its <a href="https://www.loria.fr/">LORIA</a> applications. The idea is to use the same vocabulary to describe a recipe (like those used by the project <a href="https://taaable.fr/">Taaable in</a> which Emmanuel participates), or a manufactured food product.

The ingredients are parsed from the list of ingredients in text, there are errors, the format of the lists vary a lot from one product to another. I am going to improve the parser, and in parallel contributors correct the spelling errors present in the lists.

François generated equivalences between the Open Food Facts ingredients and the same ingredients on DBPedia. They are indicated by the owl:sameAs property, for example: They are indicated by the owl:sameAs property, for example: They are indicated by the owl:sameAs property, for example: They are indicated by the owl:sameAs property, for example: They are indicated by the owl:sameAs property, for example: They are indicated by the owl:sameAs property, for example: They are indicated by the owl:sameAs property, for example: 它们由 owl:sameAs 属性表示，例如：<br>

目前没有 SPARQL 接口。 您可以将 RDF 导出加载到 Datalift 之类的工具中来执行 SPARQL 查询。 例如，这是我的第一个查询之一（查找主要成分是糖的产品）：<br>
