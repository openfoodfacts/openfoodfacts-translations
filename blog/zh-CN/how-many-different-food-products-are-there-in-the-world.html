当我发现<a href="https://world-en.openfoodfacts.org">Open Food Facts</a>时，有朋友问我世界上有多少食品。 我不知道答案, 但我们可以粗略估计一下:<br>
<br>
有些公司（如 DataMonitor）列举了所有产品发布通告, 例如 <a href="https://www.productscan.com/">产品发布在线分析服务</a>。 这些数据无疑有趣，但遗憾的是，它们是收费的。<br>
<br>
美国农业部（USDA）在报告中公布了每年的全球数据：<a href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/Briefing/FoodMarketingSystem/new_product.htm">美国食品营销系统：新产品介绍</a> 。<br>
<br>

<b>在美国, 每年大约有2万种新的食品类产品问世。 </b>该报告没有说明，但每年从货架上消失数量应该差不多。<br>
<br>
我们应该能够把这个数字乘以一个因子，估算全世界所有200个国家的总量。 以50的系数, 就能够估算<u> 每年在世界上出现100万种新的食物产品 </u>。<br>
<br>
<br>
The US report also gives the breakdown by category: <b>25% of these new products are sweets, chewing gums and snacks</b> . 20% are drinks. 20% are drinks. 20% are drinks. 20% are drinks. 20% are drinks. 20% are drinks. 20% are drinks.<br>

Another report by <a href="https://crioc.be/">CRIOC</a> (Research and Information Center of Consumer Organizations in Belgium), <a href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/Briefing/FoodMarketingSystem/new_product.htm">New food products - January 2007</a> , is based on a sample of 412 new Belgian food products. The main categories of new products were sauces (15%), snack food / snacks (13%) and soups (11%). The main categories of new products were sauces (15%), snack food / snacks (13%) and soups (11%). The main categories of new products were sauces (15%), snack food / snacks (13%) and soups (11%).  <br>
<br>
It will be very interesting to compare these figures from one country to another, and to establish correlations with the prevalence of conditions such as obesity or diabetes and the number of new products in each category.<br>
<br>
<br>
If you know of other sources of information to refine this estimate of the number of food products in the world, thank you in advance for sharing it with everyone in the comments section.<br>
<br>
Do not hesitate to suggest other estimates, with other methods of calculation for example.<br>
<br>
<br>
Anyway, we have plenty of work ahead of us, and your help to find products from around the world on <a href="https://world-en.openfoodfacts.org">Open Food Facts</a> is very welcome!<br>
