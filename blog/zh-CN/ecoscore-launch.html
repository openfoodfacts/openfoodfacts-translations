生态评分是对食品碳足迹计算的延续（自 2018 年起在 Open Food Facts 应用程序中提供，这尤其得益于 Data for Good 计划志愿者的辛勤工作）。 要知道一种产品的核心，只需使用 <a href="https://world.openfoodfacts.org/open-food-facts-mobile-app">Android 或 iPhone 的 Open Food Facts App</a> 扫描它。 <img src="https://blog.openfoodfacts.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/ecoscore_app_openfoodfacts_hand_t.jpg" alt="App Open Food Facts - Eco-Score" width="534" height="599 "> 生态评分也会显示在 <a href="https://world.openfoodfacts.org/">Open Food Facts 网站</a> 上，这样可以很容易地比较产品的生态评分，根据产品的生态评分对产品进行分类，并查看某一类产品、品牌或标签的环境评分分布。 <img src="https://blog.openfoodfacts.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/ecoscore_products_t.png" alt="产品生态评分" width="599" height="407"> The Eco-Score is calculated on the basis of life cycle analyzes (LCA) from the Agribalyse environmental database of ADEME and INRAE for 2,500 product categories. This score is modulated for each product according to their labels (organic, quality labels, etc.), their ingredients and their origins, and the materials used for their packaging.

We hope that the Eco-Score will be adopted by more and more players, and that like the Nutri-Score, it will soon appear on product packaging. Open Food Facts makes Eco-Score calculation available today for the more than 100 applications and services that use our database. 
<b>The calculation of the Eco-Score is made possible thanks to the tens of thousands of Open Food Facts contributors</b> who add photos and structure the information of food products. To accurately calculate the Eco-Score, it is indeed necessary to have detailed information on the origin of the ingredients and the materials of the packaging.

<b>We also call on manufacturers to send us directly the information</b> they already have via our free platform for producers, in order to allow a more accurate calculation of the Eco-Score.

<b>生态评分的计算得益于数以万计的 Open Food Facts 贡献者</b> 他们添加了照片并构建了食品信息。 为了准确计算生态评分，确实需要了解有关成分来源和包装材料的详细信息。 特别感谢所有参与我们伟大的 <a href="https://blog.openfoodfacts.org/news/en/wrapping-it-up">食品包装&nbsp;！ </a>&nbsp; 
的忠诚公民，<b>我们还呼吁制造商通过我们为生产商提供的免费平台直接向我们发送他们已经拥有的信息</b> ，以便更准确地计算生态评分。 该平台还允许他们获得所有产品的生态评分计算的所有细节。 今天， <b>我们计算了法国出售的 24 万种产品</b> 的生态得分。 感谢所有食品相关参与者、公民、制造商和科学家的合作，我们将能够提高生态评分，并为越来越多的产品收集越来越精确的数据。 
<b>这将使 生态评分 成为一个有用的工具，不仅对消费者来说，他们可以做出更明智的选择，而且对制造商来说，他们可以减少其产品对环境的影响。 </b>
    <i>得益于 AFNIC 基金会和法国公共卫生部的支持，生态评分的计算和生产者平台得以实现。</i>
