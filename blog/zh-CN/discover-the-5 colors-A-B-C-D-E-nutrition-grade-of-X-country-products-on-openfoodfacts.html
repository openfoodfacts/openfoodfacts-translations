In the same spirit as the appliance energy label, this system provides a rating of A to E (each associated with a color of green to red) which would be displayed voluntarily on the front of the products. . This system is part of the Health Bill of Marisol Touraine which will be debated in the National Assembly on March 31, 2015. . 该系统是将于2015年3月31日由国民议会进行辩论的Marisol Touraine健康法案的一部分。 . . . . . 该系统是将于2015年3月31日由国民议会进行辩论的Marisol Touraine健康法案的一部分。<br>

<h3><b>Open Food Facts上的色彩标注</b></h3>
We are also very pleased to have been able to provide Professor Hercberg's team with our entire product database enriched with nutritional score. Product databases such as Nutrinet and Open Food Facts allow you to test and refine the calculation formulas and the different thresholds so that the nutritional notes are the most useful.

<br>
Professor Hercberg's team sent us <a href="https://world-en.openfoodfacts.org/nutriscore">the calculation formula</a> and all the information needed to calculate the score and the nutritional score, so we were able to apply the formula to the products in the <a href="https://world.openfoodfacts.org">Open Food Facts</a> collaborative database. Scoring is possible for products for which a sufficiently complete nutrition table is shown on the packaging. To date, we have been able to determine the rating of more than 10,000 food products. 可以对包装上展示完整营养成分表的产品进行评分。 可以对包装上展示完整营养成分表的产品进行评分。 至今为止，我们已经可以给出10000多种食品的评分。<br>

<h4><b>在智能手机里应用虚拟现实技术查看营养说明。</b></h4>
We display nutritional score and color ratings on each Open Food Facts product sheet, and are also featured in our <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.openfoodfacts.scanner&hl=en">Android</a> , <a href="https://apps.apple.com/en/app/open-food-facts/id588797948">iPhone</a> and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/p/openfoodfacts/9nblggh0dkqr">Windows Phone</a> mobile <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.openfoodfacts.scanner&hl=en">apps</a> .<br>
<br>
While waiting for the possible adoption of the color note system, and its possible voluntary application by the manufacturers on the products, you can now scan the product barcodes with the Open Food Facts application to see the nutritional ratings.<br>
<br>
On Android mobiles (and soon iPhone), you do not even need to scan the barcode: thanks to the visual recognition technology of the company <a href="https://moodstocks.com/">Moodstocks</a> , simply place your phone in front of a product to see its nutritional score , and that even without internet connection, which is very useful especially in stores.<br>
<br>
<h3><b>Enthusiastic consumers, more critical manufacturers</b></h3>
The nutritional score and its implementation on Open Food Facts were presented on Friday, February 27th in the show <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTVe7P5oYT0">In search of news: "Sugars, fat, why are we all addicted?"</a> on the D8 channel.<br>

In the minutes and hours following the broadcast of the report, Open Food Facts had its biggest peak of registrations and received many positive messages by e-mail and on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/openfoodfacts/">our Facebook group</a> . It is an enthusiasm that we have seen every time we present the Open Food Facts project to the general public and the implementation of the nutritional notes on the mobile application.

This enthusiasm is however far from being shared by representatives of the food industry such as the National Association of the Food Industry (ANIA) for whom the system of color notes is simplistic, stigmatizing products and making them feel guilty about them. consumers. 消费者。 消费者。<br>

<h3><b>The weight of words, the shock of data</b></h3>
Beyond the word battles, the Open Food Facts association aims at transparency and openness of data on food products. We are convinced that these data are data of public interest - they are too important to be kept closed - and that is why we started 3 years ago to build a collaborative, free and open database , in which more than 1,500 contributors added data from more than 35,000 products.

<br>
These data have very numerous applications: decryption of labels (additives, allergens, etc.), comparison and research of products, education ... a dozen reuses of Open Food Facts data have already been inventoried.<br>
<br>
This data can test, evaluate and refine a nutritional scoring system as a whole by applying it to 10,000 products rather than to weaker samples or focusing on emblematic but sometimes anecdotal examples.<br>
<br>
To this end, we have put in place a series of tools so that everyone can test the system of color notes of the National Nutrition and Health Program:<br>
<br>
<h4><b>显示营养成分的分布</b></h4>
Open Food Facts网站使您可以从不同方面浏览数据库，例如产品类别，品牌，标签和营养说明。 The Open Food Facts website allows you to explore the database in different facets such as product categories, brands, labels, and now nutritional notes. It is now very easy to obtain the <a href="https://world.openfoodfacts.org/state/complete/nutrition-grades">distribution of nutritional notes for all products</a> or for a given brand or category, for example <a href="https://world.openfoodfacts.org/category/breakfast-cereals/nutrition-grades">breakfast cereals,</a> and to display the corresponding products of a certain grade. <br>

<h4><b>Nutrition notes by product category</b></h4>
It is interesting to compare the nutritional notes of the different categories of products. It is interesting to compare the nutritional notes of the different categories of products. It is interesting to compare the nutritional notes of the different categories of products. We can see the categories of the best rated products (fruits and vegetables, compotes) and the lowest rated (chocolate, sausage, mayonnaise).

<br>
On the other hand, the score is less useful for categories where all products have almost the same nutritional values as honeys that all obtain the D score. The system can then compare to similar categories such as <a href="https://world.openfoodfacts.org/category/spreads/nutrition-grades">spreads</a> The system can then compare to similar categories such as <a href="https://world.openfoodfacts.org/category/spreads/nutrition-grades">spreads</a> The system can then compare to similar categories such as <a href="https://world.openfoodfacts.org/category/spreads/nutrition-grades">spreads</a> The system can then compare to similar categories such as <a href="https://world.openfoodfacts.org/category/spreads/nutrition-grades">spreads</a> The system can then compare to similar categories such as <a href="https://world.openfoodfacts.org/category/spreads/nutrition-grades">spreads</a> The system can then compare to similar categories such as <a href="https://world.openfoodfacts.org/category/spreads/nutrition-grades">spreads</a> <a href="https://world.openfoodfacts.org/category/pasta/nutrition-grades">pasta</a> or <a href="https://world.openfoodfacts.org/category/jams/nutrition-grades">jams</a> or <a href="https://world.openfoodfacts.org/category/honeys/nutrition-grades">honey</a> .<br>

<h4><b>Nutritional notes of color in interactive charts</b></h4>
With a few clicks, the Open Food Facts search form allows you to create interactive charts that show all the products corresponding to certain criteria (for example category, brand, label ...) on 2 axes that you can choose (all nutrients, minerals, vitamins, number of additives, nutritional score etc.).<br>
It is now possible to also show the nutritional grade of color.<br>
<br>
For example, here's an interactive chart that shows <a href="https://world.openfoodfacts.org/cgi/search.pl?action=process&amp;tagtype_0=categories&amp;tag_contains_0=contains&amp;tag_0=microwave meals&amp;tagtype_1=nutrition_grades&amp;tag_contains_1=does_not_contain&amp;tag_1=unknown&amp;sort_by=unique_scans_n&amp;page_size=20&amp;axis_x=sugars&amp;axis_y=fat&amp;graph_title=Nutritional grades of prepared dishes&amp;series_nutrition_grades=on&amp;graph=1">the sugar, fat, and nutritional score of meals prepared for microwave heating</a> .<br>

<h3><b>From Citizen Data Collection to Citizen Science</b></h3>
We would like to thank the team of Professor Hercberg of the National Nutrition and Health Program who trusted us and gave us formulas for calculating nutritional scores and all the changes and adaptations made since September, and in particular Dr Chantal Julia who answered all our questions and requests for clarification.<br>
<br>
We are also very pleased to have been able to provide Professor Hercberg's team with our entire product database enriched with nutritional score.

<a href="https://world.openfoodfacts.org"><br>Open Food Facts</a> is a citizen project from civil society (the entire project team and 1500 contributors are volunteers). We use <i>crowdsourcing</i> to gather food data from around the world. Projects like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</a> encyclopedia and the <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org">OpenStreetMap</a> collaborative and free map have shown that people around the world can come together to achieve great things. Wikipedia and OpenStreetMap are our models and we hope that Open Food Facts can also help improve the nutrition of everyone. We are therefore particularly happy to have had the opportunity to interact and collaborate with a scientific team. It is for us a first experience of <u>citizen science</u> that we intend to renew.<br>
