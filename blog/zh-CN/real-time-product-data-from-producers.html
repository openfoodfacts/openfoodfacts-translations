<h3>时时刻刻都是最新数据</h3>
<strong>Producers can send complete information on all their products</strong>, with a reduced risk of error, <strong>and most importantly, update them automatically in real time.</strong> This is very important because the composition of many products changes over time, for example when manufacturers improve recipes to remove additives, or improve the Nutri-Score.
<h3>Data useful to everyone, including manufacturers&nbsp;!</h3>
Sharing their product data with Open Food Facts via Equadis allows manufacturers to <strong>make their products visible on the Open Food Facts app and site</strong> (used each month by more than 2 million people), <strong>and on more than 100 apps and general or specialized services</strong> that use the Open Food Facts database. Data is also used by research teams, and having complete and up-to-date data greatly facilitates their work.

«&nbsp;Every day, 2.5 billion people use Unilever products to look after their appearance, to feel good and to eat. Unilever manages a portfolio of brands in France that are very well known to the general public, with a significant number of references, sometimes seasonal, and with nutritional characteristics that are sometimes tedious to input (for example for dehydrated products). In a desire for transparency and answers to the needs of consumer actors, Unilever with its partner EQUADIS has decided to share its entire catalog, and the products now have data validated in Open Food Facts, but also for the various specialized apps that Unilever customers use every day. » Unilever manages a portfolio of brands in France that are very well known to the general public, with a significant number of references, sometimes seasonal, and with nutritional characteristics that are sometimes tedious to input (for example for dehydrated products).
