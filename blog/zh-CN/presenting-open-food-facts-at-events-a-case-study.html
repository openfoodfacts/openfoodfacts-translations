<p>We had the chance to meet the French open source, open content and open data communities, to keep a booth presenting all the latest activity at Open Food Facts, and to give talks.</p>
<p>Located between OpenStreetMap and OSGeo, that's where you would have found the Open Food Facts stand. All weekend long, many visitors came to our booth, reaching a total of about one hundred people by the end of the event.&nbsp; Located between OpenStreetMap and OSGeo, that's where you would have found the Open Food Facts stand.

<p>At such an event, the public is always very friendly, motivated to know more about how they could potentially contribute to the project.

We had prepared various posters, product packagings and QR Codes, in order to try our app, to participate in the donation campaign or to fill a form to get into the contributive community of Open Food Facts (you can read more about this <strong>Contributor Skill Pool</strong> in <a href="https://blog.openfoodfacts.org/en/news/join-a-team-of-open-food-facts-volunteers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this article</a>).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Every discussion we had was enjoyable and allowed to both identify the diverse profiles of the people interested in Open Food Facts and to make them discover the project, thus spreading once more the word about our open project.</p>
<p>The Capitole du Libre allowed me to meet various other Open Source projects. Discussing with these many committed people who share their work and knowledge is always a fulfilling experience.

<p>To create this community, we need people who can present Open Food Facts in front of as many different audiences as possible, from the most obvious to the most unlikely ones. In France, we have accepted all invitations to present our project, and each time we have quickly connected with the people who attended our presentations. Food is a universal topic of interest that everyone relates to 🥗. Explaining how we can better understand labels, easily compare products and make more informed food choices always generates a lot of interest and enthusiasm. This conference was addressed to everyone interested by the project or AI in general, with or without technical background. After presenting the history of Open Food Facts, its objectives and its community, I presented on the way Robotoff works and its use of Machine Learning to improve the quality of the database.</p>

<p>I was asked several different questions after my talk, indicating to me that the audience had been interested by what they had heard.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, I was extremely pleased to participate in the Capitole du Libre 2022 for Open Food Facts !"</p>

<h3>为什么要分享 Open Food Facts？ 🤔</h3>
<h4>Open Food Facts relies on citizen crowdsourcing of data</h4>
<p><strong>25 000 contributors have added 2.6 million products</strong> to Open Food Facts. 该数据库包括来自 100 多个不同国家/地区的产品，但其中大部分来自法国 - Open Food Facts 于 2012 年在该国推出 - 以及西班牙、英国、美国和比利时等少数几个国家，我们有一些非常积极的贡献者。 该数据库包括来自 100 多个不同国家/地区的产品，但其中大部分来自法国 - Open Food Facts 于 2012 年在该国推出 - 以及西班牙、英国、美国和比利时等少数几个国家，我们有一些非常积极的贡献者。 We would like this motivation to spread: we need to add products from your country and try to reach a critical mass of products.

It's rather short, and it's a good way to memorise the presentation 😏. However if you need help with translation, we have contributors ready to help out!</p>
<p>Please share with us your translated version (as it can serve to other contributors who wish to present).</p>
<p>Ask advice on Slack, as well as tips to print stickers and presentation material.</p>
