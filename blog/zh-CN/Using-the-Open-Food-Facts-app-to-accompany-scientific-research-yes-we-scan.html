<p>Recently, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sarah-e-n%C3%A1jera-espinosa-32b92847" target="_blank">Sarah E. Nájera Espinosa</a> (Nutrition &amp; Climate researcher and PhD Candidate at the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/" target="_blank">London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine</a>) contacted with Open Food Facts to use the database for her research.&nbsp;</p>

<p>More precisely, Sarah and her team are conducting a survey on the availability of novel plant-based food products sold in the UK. The <strong>aim of this study is to observe the availability of novel plant-based foods across different supermarkets and rate their healthiness and sustainability</strong>.

<p>To collect the data needed, we suggested to Sarah that she organises a scan party (who said research &amp; fun couldn’t go hand-in-hand ? 😉) 😉) 😉) 😉) 😉) 😉) 😉)</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So after arranging with several local Edinburgh supermarkets, Sarah and two trained volunteers proceeded to scan food barcodes and take pictures of the relevant products on&nbsp;the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://world.openfoodfacts.org/open-food-facts-mobile-app" target="_blank"><strong>Open Food Facts app</strong></a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The data collected via the app was nutrient data and certain environmental information such as type of packaging, nutrient content, ingredients, origin of product, manufacturing location.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Moreover, the trio added new products to the database and updated pictures of some brands that have changed their packaging. In total, 231 products were added to Open Food Facts !</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With this data, Sarah &amp; her team can get the Nutri-Score and Eco-Score, automatically calculated by the app’s algorithm.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The data collected will be used in research outputs such as publications, presentations and reports, relevant to this area of research.&nbsp;</p>
