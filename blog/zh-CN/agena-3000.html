<h2>Up-to-date data</h2>
<p>With the AGENA3000 connector (A3 PIM Industry), producers can send complete information on all their products, and above all, update them automatically in real time. This is very important because product information often evolves over time: recipe reformulations, updates to the visuals of product packaging, addition of labels, etc. The automation of data transfer is therefore a considerable <strong>time-saver</strong> for producers.
