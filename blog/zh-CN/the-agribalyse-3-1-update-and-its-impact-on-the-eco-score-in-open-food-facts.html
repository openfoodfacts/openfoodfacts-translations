<p>Initiated in 2013, Agribalyse is a collective and innovative programme that provides <strong>reference data on the environmental impacts of agricultural and food products</strong> through a database built according to the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The signatories of an official partnership since May 2021, the INRAE and the ADEME make this database available in open access. The Eco-Score calculation is available on more than 350,000 products out of more than 2.8 million worldwide. The Eco-Score calculation is available on more than 350,000 products out of more than 2.8 million worldwide. Thanks to the data matching work done by Open Food Facts and initially by <strong>Data4Good</strong>, users have access to the environmental impact details of many products.

<p>The 3.0.1 Agribalyse version was introduced in late 2020, it has been enhanced and improved to make way for version 3.1 in late 2022.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This new version contains more accurate data and had an impact on many Eco-Scores on <strong>Open Food Facts</strong> and helps to better inform interested consumers, contributors, and professionals.<br></p>

<p>The big advantage of the Eco-Score methodology through the use of Agribalyse is its ability to estimate the environmental impact of products <strong>on a large scale.</strong></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This version of Agribalyse also contains new LCAs, and therefore the possibility to calculate the Eco-Score on even more products. It also allows for methodological, structuring and diffusion improvements, for instance, by expanding the product categories covered in version 3.1 compared to version 3.0.1.

[...]The changes resulted in changed Eco-Scores for over 150,000 products. [...] I then, finally, got to add in the new categories for vegan and other products that had recently been introduced. This now meant that around 9,000 products had an EcoScore where they didn’t have one before, including many of my favourite vegan products. The change was deployed to production just over a month after that first introduction to the team on Slack.” </em><strong>- John Gomersal, English contributor at Open Food Facts*.</strong></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
