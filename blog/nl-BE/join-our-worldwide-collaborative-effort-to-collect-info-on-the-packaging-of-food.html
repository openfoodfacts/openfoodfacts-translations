In 2015, Open Food Facts was the first to compute and display the Nutri-Score for all food products. Today, we are proud to be part of the collective of committed actors who are launching <a href="https://world.openfoodfacts.org/eco-score-the-environmental-impact-of-food-products"> <b>Eco-Score</b></a><b>, the score from A to E that evaluates the impacts of food on the environment. <br />

<br />
The Eco-Score is a continuation of the computation of the carbon footprint of food products (available on the Open Food Facts app since 2018, made possible in particular by all the work of the volunteers of the Data for Good program). <br />
<br />
To know the ecoscore of a product, just scan it with <a href="https://world.openfoodfacts.org/open-food-facts-mobile-app"> the Open Food Facts app for Android or iPhone. <br />

<br />
The Eco-Score is also displayed on </a><a href="https://world.openfoodfacts.org">the Open Food Facts website</a> which makes it very easy to compare the ecoscore of products, to classify the products according to their Eco-Score, and to see the distribution of the environmental score for a product category, a brand, or a label.<br />
<br />

<br />
The Eco-Score is calculated on the basis of life cycle analyzes (LCA) from the Agribalyse environmental database of ADEME and INRAE ​​for 2,500 product categories. <br />
<br />
This score is modulated for each product according to their labels (organic, quality labels, etc.), their ingredients and their origins, and the materials used for their packaging.<br />
<br />
<h3><b>A climate issue that requires the collaboration of all stakeholders and all citizens</b></h3>
The Eco-Score is supported by a group of 8 committed digital and food actors: <br />

<br />
We hope that the Eco-Score will be adopted by more and more players, and that like the Nutri-Score, it will soon appear on product packagings. Open Food Facts now makes the Eco-Score computation available for the more than 100 applications and services that use our database.<br />
<br />
<b>The Eco-Score computation is made possible thanks to the tens of thousands of Open Food Facts contributors</b> who add photos and structure food product information. To precisely compute the Eco-Score, it is indeed necessary to have detailed information on the origin of the ingredients and the packaging materials. A big thank you in particular to all the committed citizens who participate in our big <a href="https://en.blog.openfoodfacts.org/news/join-our-worldwide-collaborative-effort-to-collect-info-on-the-packaging-of-food"> collaborative inventory of food product packaging&#160;!</a>&#160;<br />
<br />
<b> We also call on manufacturers to send us the information they already have </b> directly to us via our free platform for producers, in order to allow a more precise calculation of the Eco-Score. The platform will also allow them to obtain all the details of the Eco-Score calculation for all of their products. <br />
<br />
Today, <b>we have computed on Open Food Facts the Eco-score of more than 240,000 products</b> sold in France. <br />
<br />
Thanks to the collaboration of all involved food stakeholders, citizens, manufacturers and scientists, we will be able to improve the Eco-Score and collect increasingly precise data for more and more products. <br />
<br />
<b>This will make the Eco-Score a useful tool both for consumers to make more informed choices, and for manufacturers to reduce the&#160;</b><b>environmental&#160;</b><b>impact of their products on the market.</b><br />
<br />
<i>The calculation of the Eco-Score and the platform for producers are made possible thanks to the support of the AFNIC Foundation and Public Health France. <br />
