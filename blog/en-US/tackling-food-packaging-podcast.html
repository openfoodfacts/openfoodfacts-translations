<p>Participating in the podcast was an opportunity to <strong>full the pot on packaging</strong>, but not only!&nbsp;We were also able to present the association, its <strong>objectives</strong>, its <strong>actions</strong> but also the different <strong>use platforms</strong> it has. Indeed, by addressing topics such as the website, the mobile application, and the platform for producers in a way accessible to all; it was an opportunity to share, exchange and give an overview of some of the scope of Open Food Facts' activities in a brand new format!</p>

<p>The topic at the heart of the interview was the packaging landscape in France and Europe as well as the actions taken by Open Food Facts to contribute to research. We were able to approach it by referring to figures and facts collected by various institutions and organizations such as <a href="https://www.ademe.fr/">ADEME</a> (Agence de la ecological transition) and <a href="https://www.circle-economy.com/">Circle Economy</a>, and of course by presenting the special operation&nbsp; ‚Äú<strong>Full Pot on Packaging</strong>‚Äù promoted by Open Food Facts and ADEME.&nbsp;</p>
