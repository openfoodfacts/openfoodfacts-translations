The data of <a href="https://world.openfoodfacts.org">Open Food Facts</a> were already open and free (in <i>open data</i> as they say), and now they are also linked. And yes, free and linked at once!<br>
<br>
Free because the open license allows the data to be used by all and for any purpose, and linked because the data is now linked not only to each other, but also to other datasets, via the database DBPedia.<br>
<br>
Let me rephrase that: there is now a large file that contains Open Food Facts data on products, their ingredients and their nutritional composition. The products are related to the ingredients they contain, and the ingredients (some to start) refer to their page on <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/DBpedia">DBPedia</a> (a database from Wikipedia articles). This file is not for humans, but for programs. It is possible to query it, to formulate queries as "which are the products whose main ingredient is sugar", and to cross it easily with other datasets.<br>
<br>
Thanks to this file, the OFF data is now part of what is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_data">"Linked Data" or "the Web of Data"</a> . The data is more easily reusable.<br>

Will Open Food Facts data soon be linked with lots of other datasets?<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3><b>The technical details:<br>
</b></h3>
I took part in the <b>Datalift Camp to</b> which Charles Nepote of <a href="https://datalift.org/">Datalift</a> invited me, and it was my first time with the Datalift tool. We started to "play" with the OFF data to see how to express it in RDF.<br>
<br>
The data on ingredients and nutrients are described by an <a href="https://data.lirmm.fr/ontologies/food">ontology food</a> that we are creating with <b>François Scharffe</b> of the Laboratory of Informatics, Robotics and Microelectronics of Montpellier <a href="https://www.lirmm.fr/">LIRMM</a> and <b>Emmanuel Nauer</b> of the Lorrain Laboratory of Research in Computer Science and its <a href="https://www.loria.fr/">LORIA</a> applications. The idea is to use the same vocabulary to describe a recipe (like those used by the project <a href="https://taaable.fr/">Taaable in</a> which Emmanuel participates), or a manufactured food product.<br>
<br>
The RDF export is here: <a href="https://world.openfoodfacts.org/data/en.openfoodfacts.org.products.rdf">https://world.openfoodfacts.org/data/en.openfoodfacts.org.products.rdf</a> (in XML / RDF)<br>
<br>
And it is <a href="https://datahub.io/dataset/open-food-facts">referenced on The Data Hub</a> to facilitate the discovery of the Open Food Facts dataset.<br>
<br>
The ingredients are parsed from the list of ingredients in text, there are errors, the format of the lists vary a lot from one product to another. I am going to improve the parser, and in parallel contributors correct the spelling errors present in the lists.<br>
<br>
The product and ingredient URLs currently return the HTML webpage, but I'm going to add the content negotiation to return the RDF.<br>
<br>
François generated equivalences between the Open Food Facts ingredients and the same ingredients on DBPedia. They are indicated by the owl:sameAs property, for example:<br>
<pre><rdf:description rdf:about="https://world.openfoodfacts.org/ingredient/potassium-sorbate" rdf:type="https://data.lirmm.fr/ontologies/food#Food"></rdf:description> &lt;food:name&gt; Potassium sorbate &lt;/food:name&gt;<br>&lt;owl:sameAs rdf:resource="https://en.dbpedia.org/resource/Sorbate_of_potassium" /&gt;<br>&lt;/rdf:Description&gt;</pre>
<br>
There is currently no SPARQL endpoint. You can instead load the RDF export into a tool like Datalift to execute SPARQL queries. As an example, here is one of my first queries (to find products whose main ingredient is sugar):<br>
<pre>PREFIX food: <a class="moz-txt-link-rfc2396E" href="https://data.lirmm.fr/ontologies/food#">&lt;https://data.lirmm.fr/ontologies/food#&gt;</a><br>SELECT?s?WHERE code {<br>   ?s <a class="moz-txt-link-rfc2396E" href="https://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type">&lt;https://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type&gt;</a> food: FoodProduct.<br>   ?s food: containsIngredient?i.
   ?i food: food <a class="moz-txt-link-rfc2396E" href="https://world.openfoodfacts.org/ingredient/sugar">&lt;https://world.openfoodfacts.org/ingredient/sugar&gt;</a> .
   ?i food: rank "1" OPTIONAL {?s food: code?code}.<br>}</pre>
<br>
This is of course a work in progress, there is still a lot of data missing in the RDF export (brands, categories etc.). They will be added gradually.<br>
<br>
Your ideas, comments, suggestions etc. are welcome to improve these data, link them better, represent them better etc. Moreover if you use the data, it would be nice to tell us. Thank you in advance !<br>
<br>
And of course a big thank you to Emmanuel and François for their help!<br>
