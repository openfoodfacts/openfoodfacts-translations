  </b> You can now easily create charts to visualize the data of your choice for the products of your choice from those we collected together on 
  <a href="https://world.openfoodfacts.org">Open Food Facts</a>.
  <br>
  <br>
  In practice, I completed the advanced search form (which on the website is now titled 
  <a href="https://world.openfoodfacts.org/cgi/search.pl">Advanced Search and Charts
  </a>, link at the top right) so you can choose to view the products matching your search criteria (name, categories, labels, brands, and nutritional composition etc.) in graphical form.
  <br>
  <br>
  The products are placed on 2 axes that you choose. For now it can be any nutrients or the number of additives.
  <br>
  <br>
  Here's what it can do if you choose to represent the Sodas that were collected during
  <a href="https://world.openfoodfacts.org/operation-sodas">the Sodas Operation
  </a> according to their sugar content and the number of additives they contain&nbsp;:

  <br>
  When you generate a graph, you then have a 
  <a href="https://world.openfoodfacts.org/cgi/search.pl?action=process&amp;tagtype_0=categories&amp;tag_contains_0=contains&amp;tag_0=sodas&amp;sort_by=product_name&amp;page_size=20&amp;axis_x=sugars&amp;axis_y=additives_n&amp;graph_title=Sucres%20et%20additifs%20dans%20les%20sodas&amp;series_organic=on&amp;series_fairtrade=on&amp;series_with_sweeteners=on&amp;generate_graph_scatter_plot=1">link to the graph
  </a> which allows you to share it on social networks, by e-mail etc.
  <br>
  <br>
  The graph on the site is dynamic: by hovering over each point with the mouse, you can see the corresponding product, with a link to the complete product sheet.
  <br>
  <br>
  Depending on the products you represent, you can choose the most relevant axes, for example the salt and fat content for deli meats, carbohydrates and fats for breakfast cereals,… 
  <br>
  <br>
  <b>Even more graphing possibilities
    <br>
  </b>
  <br>
   This "Cloud of Points" graph is the first type of graph that can be created directly on Open Food Facts. Of course, you can create many more by downloading data and analyzing it with software like Open Office, Google Refine or Excel. But it seems very interesting to me to easily create graphics directly on Open Food Facts: 2 steps in less (the download of data and their import into an external software) make the creation of graphics much more accessible to the general public.
  <br>
  <br>
  Developing graphing possibilities on Open Food Facts has another advantage: we can imagine features specifically adapted to food products. For example, I would like to add a graph to visualize the dyes used in products as a "pie chart", with the color of each slice calculated for each combination of dyes. For cheeses whose beautiful crust is colored with carmines (red) and annatto (yellow), we would have a nice orange slice.
  <br>
  <br>
  <b>And what are your ideas&nbsp;?
    <br>
  </b>
  <br>
  What kind of graphics would you like to be able to create with the data from Open Food Facts &nbsp; It goes without saying that pie charts have their place on Open Food Facts. ;-)
  <br>
  <br>
  What other data would be interesting to visualize on the axes of the "product cloud"?
  <br>
  <br>
  If you generate interesting graphics, you can share them as a comment to this article, I'm very interested to see how this kind of feature can be used and useful.
  <br>
  <br>
  Note: Before publishing a graph generated with the data, it is a good idea to look at the corresponding products at the most extreme points. An error in data entry is always possible, so if a value seems very high or very low, it's a good idea to double-check it.
