<div><i>In partnership with <a href="https://eren.univ-paris13.fr/index.php/fr/"><i>EREN</i></a> (The Nutritional Epidemiology Research Team -&nbsp; Inserm/Inra/CNAM/University of Paris),<a href="https://world.openfoodfacts.org/">Open Food Facts</a> calls its contributors to add all dental hygiene products to the <a href="https://world.openbeautyfacts.org/">Open Beauty Facts</i></a>database.</i>

Tooth brushing is a ritual that we repeat daily. Every day, and several times a day, we use our toothpaste or our mouthwash to ensure our oral hygiene. But their ingredient lists are often long and complex. Some reveal the presence of additives, such as sweeteners or titanium dioxide, whose long-term effects are still unknown.

<b>Scientists are now interested in exposure to additives through food but also through toothpaste when brushing teeth.</b> For this, it is necessary that we add all toothpastes and mouthwashes to the <a href="https://world.openbeautyfacts.org/" style="text-decoration-line: none;">Open Beauty Facts</a> database, in order to have a precise idea of the compositions of these products on the market.

The EREN researchers (the creators of the Nutri-Score with whom Open Food Facts has been collaborating for many years) will cross-reference the data we have collected thanks to you with those of the <a href="https://etude-nutrinet-sante.fr/">NutriNet-Santé</a> cohort. This will provide insight into the long-term effects of oral hygiene products.

This will also allow everyone to choose their toothpaste or mouthwash in a more informed way.

<b>Long live participatory science!</b>

<b>Open Food Facts loves science,</b> and even more so when everyone can participate! Operation Toothpaste is one of the actions carried out as part of the project <i>Use of the Open Food Facts citizen database within the Nutrinet Santé cohort</i>, winner of <a href="https://u-paris.fr/science-et-recherche-participative-8-projets-finances/" style="text-decoration-line: none;">the call for Participatory Sciences projects of the University of Paris</a> which aims to involve citizens in the collection of data, in their interpretation, and/or in the co-production of the research project.

<b>Complete the information in the product sheets</b>

Create an account on the <a href="https://world.openbeautyfacts.org/" style="text-decoration-line: none;">Open Beauty Facts</a> website (if you already have an Open Food Facts, it's the same) to complete the toothpaste product sheets thanks to the photos received.

<b>A call to toothpaste and cosmetic manufacturers</b>

You can also participate in the operation and transparency of product information by sending us photos and information of your products, using the <a href="https://world.pro.openfoodfacts.org/" style ="text-decoration-line: none;">Open Food Facts producer platform</a> (which also works for cosmetics). The platform makes it easy to send photos and data with an Excel table of any format, <a href="https://blog.openfoodfacts.org/en/news/real-time-product-data-from-producers-on-open-food-facts-thanks-to-the-new-equadis-integration" style="text-decoration-line: none;">or automatically via Equadis</a>.

For instance, Unilever already transmits automatically and in real time the information of all its food products but also cosmetics on Open Food Facts and Open Beauty Facts.
