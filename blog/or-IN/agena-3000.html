<p>More than 150 producers are now contributing to food transparency by uploading their product data to <a href="https://world.openfoodfacts.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Open Food Facts</a>, using a dedicated tool: the <a href="https://world.pro.openfoodfacts.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>pro platform</strong></a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For producers who are clients of <a href="https://www.agena3000.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AGENA3000</a>, a specialist in food data management, sharing product photos and data on Open Food Facts is now possible in just a few clicks. ðŸš€</p>
<h2>Up-to-date data</h2>
<p>With the AGENA3000 connector (A3 PIM Industry), producers can send complete information on all their products, and above all, update them automatically in real time. This is very important because product information often evolves over time: recipe reformulations, updates to the visuals of product packaging, addition of labels, etc. The automation of data transfer is therefore a considerable <strong>time-saver</strong> for producers.</p>
