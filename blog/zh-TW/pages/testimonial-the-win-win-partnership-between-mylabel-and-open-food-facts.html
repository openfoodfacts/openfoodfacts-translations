<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td class="has-text-align-center" data-align="center">The starting point came from Christophe Hurbin, today president of myLabel, who had the chance, as a space engineer, to see the Earth "from space", with its riches and its fragilities, which left a lasting impression on him. Then he managed a very large factory in France where the challenge was to innovate on the environmental impact and working conditions. But these aspects were not visible to consumers, who made no difference to a competing product made under unacceptable conditions.<br><br>This is how the idea of myLabel was born: to make information and an evaluation of products according to social, environmental and health criteria available at the time of purchase. We have chosen to rely on trusted third parties that are trusted by consumers: a network of associations, NGOs and independent committed actors ready to share their expertise. After a pilot application with 1,000 test users, we launched myLabel in April 2019.<br><br>The aim of myLabel is to enable consumers - especially the most disadvantaged in terms of information or budget - to better understand the impact of their consumption on the environment and their well-being, and to find alternatives that are acceptable to them. We have written this desire into our company statutes and obtained ESUS (Entreprise Solidaire d'Utilité Sociale) approval.<br></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
