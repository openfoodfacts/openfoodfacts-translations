<div>In 2015, Open Food Facts was the first to calculate and display the Nutri-Score for all food products. Today, we are proud to be part of the collective of committed actors who are launching <a href="https://world.openfoodfacts.org/eco-score-the-environmental-impact-of-food-products"><b>Eco-Score</b></a><b>, the grade from A to E to assess the impact of food on the environment.</b>

The Eco-Score is a continuation of the calculation of the carbon footprint of food products (available in the Open Food Facts app since 2018, made possible in particular by all the work of the volunteers of the Data for Good program). To know the ecoscore of a product, simply scan it with <a href="https://world.openfoodfacts.org/open-food-facts-mobile-app">the Open Food Facts app</a> for Android or iPhone. <img src="https://blog.openfoodfacts.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/ecoscore_app_openfoodfacts_hand_t.jpg" alt="App Open Food Facts - Eco-Score" width="534" height="599 "> The Eco-Score is also displayed on <a href="https://world.openfoodfacts.org/">the Open Food Facts site</a> which makes it very easy to compare the ecoscore of products, to classify products according to their Eco-Score, and to see the distribution of the environmental score for a category of products, a brand, or a label. <img src="https://blog.openfoodfacts.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/ecoscore_products_t.png" alt="Eco-Score of products" width="599" height="407"> The Eco-Score is calculated on the basis of life cycle analyzes (LCA) from the Agribalyse environmental database of ADEME and INRAE for 2,500 product categories. 我們會根據產品的標籤（有機、品質標籤等）、成分、產地和包裝材料，來調整各種產品的環保評分。

<h3><b>要改善氣候問題，必須依靠所有利害關係人與公民共同合作</b></h3>

The Eco-Score is carried by a collective of 8 committed digital and food players:

We hope that the Eco-Score will be adopted by more and more players, and that like the Nutri-Score, it will soon appear on product packaging. Open Food Facts makes Eco-Score calculation available today for the more than 100 applications and services that use our database. 
<b>The calculation of the Eco-Score is made possible thanks to the tens of thousands of Open Food Facts contributors</b> who add photos and structure the information of food products. To accurately calculate the Eco-Score, it is indeed necessary to have detailed information on the origin of the ingredients and the materials of the packaging. A big thank you in particular to all the committed citizens who participate in our great <a href="https://blog.openfoodfacts.org/news/en/wrapping-it-up">collaborative inventory of food product packaging&nbsp;!</a>&nbsp; 
<b>We also call on manufacturers to send us directly the information</b> they already have via our free platform for producers, in order to allow a more accurate calculation of the Eco-Score. 此外，製造商也可以利用平台取得自家所有產品的環保評分計算詳細資訊。 Today, <b>we calculated on Open Food Facts the Eco-score of more than 240,000 products</b> sold in France. Thanks to the collaboration of all the actors involved in food, citizens, manufacturers and scientists, we will be able to improve the Eco-Score and collect more and more precise data for more and more products. 
<b>This will make the Eco-Score a useful tool both for consumers so that they can make more informed choices, and for manufacturers so that they can reduce the impact of their products on the environment. environment.</b>
    <i>The calculation of the Eco-Score and the platform for producers are made possible thanks to the support of the AFNIC Foundation and Public Health France.</i>
