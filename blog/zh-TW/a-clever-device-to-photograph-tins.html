Daniel (alias dada) had already presented his ingenious <a href="https://fr.blog.openfoodfacts.org/news/un-mini-studio-photo-pret-a-l-emploi-et-transportable-dans-un-tiroir">mini transportable photo studio</a> , he now offers us another very clever contraption that can take shots packaging tin can or more generally cylindrical products.<br>

This is a problem we have on Open Food Facts: the photos of the labels on the bottles, cans and cans are distorted, and it is almost impossible to do automatic recognition of characters to avoid having to seize by hand the list of ingredients for example. On some labels that go around, it is even impossible to take a single photo that reads the entire list of ingredients!

The principle of Daniel's editing is simple, a small hand scanner is attached severally to a school ruler to make parallel lines.  The assembly is guided by two ribbons on a plane inclined at 30 ° (depending on the diameter of the cylinder to be scanned, the right angle of the scanner is "wedged" with plasticine).

Simply by gravity, by making the scanner descend from the inclined plane, the ruler lets the cylindrical packaging roll against the scanner that reads the text of the label.  This simple assembly is useful in the case of large amount of scanning canisters.  This simple assembly is useful in the case of large amount of scanning canisters.
