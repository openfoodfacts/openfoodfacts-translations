<h3>隨時保持最新資料</h3>
<strong>Producers can send complete information on all their products</strong>, with a reduced risk of error, <strong>and most importantly, update them automatically in real time.</strong> This is very important because the composition of many products changes over time, for example when manufacturers improve recipes to remove additives, or improve the Nutri-Score.
<h3>Data useful to everyone, including manufacturers&nbsp;!</h3>
Sharing their product data with Open Food Facts via Equadis allows manufacturers to <strong>make their products visible on the Open Food Facts app and site</strong> (used each month by more than 2 million people), <strong>and on more than 100 apps and general or specialized services</strong> that use the Open Food Facts database. 這些資料也可供研究團隊使用，讓團隊藉由最完整、最新的資料，大幅提升工作效率。

<span style="font-weight: bold;">The integration of data via Equadis also gives access to the free Open Food Facts platform for producers which also allows&nbsp;:</span>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>說明額外資訊</strong> (例如品牌官網上產品詳情的連結、客服和銷售部門的詳細聯絡資料)</li>
 	<li><strong>compute and check their Nutri-Score</strong>, the <strong>NOVA</strong> processing level<strong> and very soon the Eco-score</strong></li>
 	<li><strong>to identify opportunities for product improvement</strong> (for example, when possible, we propose reachable changes in composition to improve the Nutri-Score)</li>

«&nbsp;Every day, 2.5 billion people use Unilever products to look after their appearance, to feel good and to eat. Unilever manages a portfolio of brands in France that are very well known to the general public, with a significant number of references, sometimes seasonal, and with nutritional characteristics that are sometimes tedious to input (for example for dehydrated products). In a desire for transparency and answers to the needs of consumer actors, Unilever with its partner EQUADIS has decided to share its entire catalog, and the products now have data validated in Open Food Facts, but also for the various specialized apps that Unilever customers use every day. »</td>

</strong>
«&nbsp;In a desire for transparency and continuous updating, Barilla has been sending Open Food Facts since 2018 the information and photos of the products of its Barilla, Harry's and Wasa brands. The regular improvement of recipes is indeed a key point at Barilla, in order to provide consumers with products of optimal nutritional quality (more than 450 recipes reformulated since 2010, elimination of additives on more and more products). Thanks to the integration of data into Open Food Facts via Equadis, updating is now automatic.»</td>
