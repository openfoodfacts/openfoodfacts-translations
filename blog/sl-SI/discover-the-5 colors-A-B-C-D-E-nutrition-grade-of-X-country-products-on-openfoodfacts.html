<br>
Simplifying nutrition labeling on packaging to help consumers choose healthier foods is the goal of the five-color scoring system proposed by Professor Serge Hercberg of the French National Nutrition and Health Program.<br>

<br>
V istem duhu kot energetska oznaka naprave, ta sistem zagotavlja oceno od A do E (vsaka je povezana z barvo od zelene do rdeče), ki bi bila prostovoljno prikazana na sprednji strani izdelkov. . Ta sistem je del zakona o zdravju Marisol Touraine, o katerem je bila razprava v Državnem zboru 31. marca 2015.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Več sadja in zelenjave, beljakovin in vlaknin, manj kalorij, sladkorja, nasičenih maščob in soli.</b><br>
<br>
<i>"5 sadij in zelenjave na dan"</i> , <i> "manj maščobe, manj sladko, manj slano" </i> : barvne opombe poskušajo sintetizirati ta sporočila, ki so splošno znana javnosti, vendar niso nujno enostavna za uporabo pri nakupovanju.<br>
<br>
Da bi se ugotovil prehrambeni rezultat, se najprej izračuna prehranska ocena, ki upošteva vsebino elementov, za katere je bilo ugotovljeno, da so hranilno ugodne (sadje in zelenjava, beljakovine in vlaknine) in elementi, ki se štejejo za neugodne. energija, preprosti sladkorji, nasičene maščobne kisline in natrij, ki ustrezajo soli). Zelene, rumene, oranžne, vijolična in rdeče barve (A, B, C, D, E) ustrezajo različnim presledkom hranilne vrednosti. <br>
<br>
<b>Opomba za primerjavo živil pri nakupovanju</b><br>
<br>
Unlike other rating systems (such as recommended daily intake percentages), the score is independent of the portion indicated by the manufacturer, which is often different for each brand and is sometimes underestimated compared to the portion actually consumed.<br>
Not linking the note to the size of the portion makes it possible to compare the notes of different products before choosing which one to buy.<br>
<br>
<h3><b>Barvne opombe v Open Food Facts</b></h3>
We contacted Professor Hercberg at the end of September 2014 to ask him for the exact formula of the nutritional score and the thresholds for determining the 5-color notes A / B / C / D / E recommended in his report <a href="https://www.sante.gouv.fr/IMG/pdf/rapport_Hercberg_15_11_2013.pdf">"Proposals for a new impetus of the policy public health nutrition as part of the National Health Strategy "</a> .<br>
<br>
Professor Hercberg's team sent us <a href="https://world-en.openfoodfacts.org/nutriscore">the calculation formula</a> and all the information needed to calculate the score and the nutritional score, so we were able to apply the formula to the products in the <a href="https://world.openfoodfacts.org">Open Food Facts</a> collaborative database. Scoring is possible for products for which a sufficiently complete nutrition table is shown on the packaging. To date, we have been able to determine the rating of more than 10,000 food products.<br>

<h4><b>Oglejte si prehranske note na svojem pametnem telefonu v razširjeni resničnosti</b></h4>
We display nutritional score and color ratings on each Open Food Facts product sheet, and are also featured in our <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.openfoodfacts.scanner&hl=en">Android</a> , <a href="https://apps.apple.com/en/app/open-food-facts/id588797948">iPhone</a> and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/p/openfoodfacts/9nblggh0dkqr">Windows Phone</a> mobile <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.openfoodfacts.scanner&hl=en">apps</a> .<br>

Med čakanjem na možno sprejetje sistema barvnih zapisov in njegovo morebitno prostovoljno uporabo s strani proizvajalcev, lahko zdaj skenirate črtne kode izdelkov s programom Open Food Facts in si ogledate prehranske ocene.<br>
<br>
On Android mobiles (and soon iPhone), you do not even need to scan the barcode: thanks to the visual recognition technology of the company <a href="https://moodstocks.com/">Moodstocks</a> , simply place your phone in front of a product to see its nutritional score , and that even without internet connection, which is very useful especially in stores.<br>
<br>
<h3><b>Enthusiastic consumers, more critical manufacturers</b></h3>
The nutritional score and its implementation on Open Food Facts were presented on Friday, February 27th in the show <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTVe7P5oYT0">In search of news: "Sugars, fat, why are we all addicted?"</a> on the D8 channel.<br>
<br>

<br>
In the minutes and hours following the broadcast of the report, Open Food Facts had its biggest peak of registrations and received many positive messages by e-mail and on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/openfoodfacts/">our Facebook group</a> . It is an enthusiasm that we have seen every time we present the Open Food Facts project to the general public and the implementation of the nutritional notes on the mobile application.<br>
<br>
This enthusiasm is however far from being shared by representatives of the food industry such as the National Association of the Food Industry (ANIA) for whom the system of color notes is simplistic, stigmatizing products and making them feel guilty about them. potrošniki.<br>
<br>
<h3><b>Teža besed, šok podatkov</b></h3>
Beyond the word battles, the Open Food Facts association aims at transparency and openness of data on food products. We are convinced that these data are data of public interest - they are too important to be kept closed - and that is why we started 3 years ago to build a collaborative, free and open database , in which more than 1,500 contributors added data from more than 35,000 products.<br>
<br>
These data have very numerous applications: decryption of labels (additives, allergens, etc.), comparison and research of products, education ... a dozen reuses of Open Food Facts data have already been inventoried.<br>
<br>
This data can test, evaluate and refine a nutritional scoring system as a whole by applying it to 10,000 products rather than to weaker samples or focusing on emblematic but sometimes anecdotal examples.<br>
<br>
To this end, we have put in place a series of tools so that everyone can test the system of color notes of the National Nutrition and Health Program:<br>
<br>
<h4><b>Prikaz porazdelitve prehranskih opomb</b></h4>
The Open Food Facts website allows you to explore the database in different facets such as product categories, brands, labels, and now nutritional notes. It is now very easy to obtain the <a href="https://world.openfoodfacts.org/state/complete/nutrition-grades">distribution of nutritional notes for all products</a> or for a given brand or category, for example <a href="https://world.openfoodfacts.org/category/breakfast-cereals/nutrition-grades">breakfast cereals,</a> and to display the corresponding products of a certain grade. <br>
<br>

<h4><b>Prehranske opombe po kategorijah izdelkov</b></h4>
It is interesting to compare the nutritional notes of the different categories of products. We can see the categories of the best rated products (fruits and vegetables, compotes) and the lowest rated (chocolate, sausage, mayonnaise).<br>
<br>
You can also see which categories have products that have a wide variety of ratings. It is for these categories that the rating system is the most useful because it allows consumers to take into account the nutritional score in their choices, and it can encourage manufacturers to improve the formulation of their products for them get better grades.<br>
<br>
On the other hand, the score is less useful for categories where all products have almost the same nutritional values as honeys that all obtain the D score. The system can then compare to similar categories such as <a href="https://world.openfoodfacts.org/category/spreads/nutrition-grades">spreads</a> <a href="https://world.openfoodfacts.org/category/pasta/nutrition-grades">testenine</a> or <a href="https://world.openfoodfacts.org/category/jams/nutrition-grades">jams</a> or <a href="https://world.openfoodfacts.org/category/honeys/nutrition-grades">honey</a> .<br>
<br>
<h4><b>Nutritional notes of color in interactive charts</b></h4>
With a few clicks, the Open Food Facts search form allows you to create interactive charts that show all the products corresponding to certain criteria (for example category, brand, label ...) on 2 axes that you can choose (all nutrients, minerals, vitamins, number of additives, nutritional score etc.).<br>
It is now possible to also show the nutritional grade of color.<br>
<br>
For example, here's an interactive chart that shows <a href="https://world.openfoodfacts.org/cgi/search.pl?action=process&amp;tagtype_0=categories&amp;tag_contains_0=contains&amp;tag_0=microwave meals&amp;tagtype_1=nutrition_grades&amp;tag_contains_1=does_not_contain&amp;tag_1=unknown&amp;sort_by=unique_scans_n&amp;page_size=20&amp;axis_x=sugars&amp;axis_y=fat&amp;graph_title=Nutritional grades of prepared dishes&amp;series_nutrition_grades=on&amp;graph=1">the sugar, fat, and nutritional score of meals prepared for microwave heating</a> .<br>

<h3><b>From Citizen Data Collection to Citizen Science</b></h3>
We would like to thank the team of Professor Hercberg of the National Nutrition and Health Program who trusted us and gave us formulas for calculating nutritional scores and all the changes and adaptations made since September, and in particular Dr Chantal Julia who answered all our questions and requests for clarification.<br>
<br>
We are also very pleased to have been able to provide Professor Hercberg's team with our entire product database enriched with nutritional score. Product databases such as Nutrinet and Open Food Facts allow you to test and refine the calculation formulas and the different thresholds so that the nutritional notes are the most useful.<br>
<a href="https://world.openfoodfacts.org"><br>Open Food Facts</a> is a citizen project from civil society (the entire project team and 1500 contributors are volunteers). We use <i>crowdsourcing</i> to gather food data from around the world. Projects like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</a> encyclopedia and the <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org">OpenStreetMap</a> collaborative and free map have shown that people around the world can come together to achieve great things. Wikipedia and OpenStreetMap are our models and we hope that Open Food Facts can also help improve the nutrition of everyone. We are therefore particularly happy to have had the opportunity to interact and collaborate with a scientific team. It is for us a first experience of <u>citizen science</u> that we intend to renew.<br>
