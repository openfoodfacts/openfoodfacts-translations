<h2>Day 1</h2>
<p>First of all, it was so exciting to <strong>meet many of our community members</strong>, some that have contributed to the project for many years, for the first time in person!&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was also a privilege to <strong>welcome new contributors</strong> who share the same passion for positive impact, food transparency and open source projects.</p>
<p>Thanks to the City of Paris, we were able to host this edition of the Open Food Facts Days 22 at the <strong><a href="https://www.academieduclimat.paris/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Climate Academy</a></strong>, a grand French building from 1868 and a former town hall of the 4th arrondissement.&nbsp;</p>

<figcaption>Programme of the weekend</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>After a brief <strong>introduction of the project&rsquo;s progress</strong>, we jumped straight into one of our <strong>3 sessions of <em>barcamp</em> workshops</strong> of the day. We really wanted the Open Food Facts community days to focus on what the community is most interested in, so we chose a <em>barcamp</em> format where the attendants create the programme in real time. Everyone suggested topics to discuss, then each one decides in which room to go to participate in the workshops they are the most interested in.</p>
<p>Some of the subjects that these workshops focused on were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Avoiding food waste&nbsp;</li>
<li>包装</li>
<li>Infrastructure</li>
<li>Eco-Score - GreenWashing</li>
<li>User Research</li>
<li>Data Quality</li>
<li>Non-food products</li>
<li>Internationalisation</li>
<li>Taxonomies</li>
</ul>
<p>You can find <a href="https://cryptpad.fr/pad/#/2/pad/edit/sFqk7OUBjBG-TkK3XHD8uada/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a> the notes taken during all barcamps.

<h2>Day 2</h2>
<p>On Sunday, we held our <strong><a href="https://youtu.be/Yzf0j8aG40E">General Assembly</a>,</strong> a key moment in the life of our non-profit association. The <strong>activity report for 2021</strong> was presented, and the assembly <strong>elected 4 new members to the Board of Directors</strong> (Anca, Eloise, Marie and S&eacute;bastien). It was a chance for some of the newcomers to discover the significance of being a non-profit organisation &amp; how it runs.
