<p>Contrary to popular belief, most of the waste we produce is not recycled but buried or burned. <strong>Globally </strong><a href="https://www.circularity-gap.world/2022" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>less than 10%</strong></a><strong> of our waste resources are recycled</strong>, either because we don&rsquo;t know how to recycle the material or because we don&rsquo;t collect it.

<p>Despite this, reducing waste impact is critical to many of us:<strong> 29%</strong> of French people consider that waste management is one of the most concerning environmental issues (source: <a href="https://librairie.ademe.fr/cadic/6912/dechets-chiffres-cles-lessentiel-2021-011723.pdf?modal_token=cf05bd2bb8c7c368fc0c747d21edea56&amp;modal=true&amp;cookies_allowed=true&amp;open=true&amp;firstname=&amp;lastname=&amp;email=raphael0202%40yahoo.fr&amp;rgpd=on&amp;submitted=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ademe</a>).</p>
<p>As<strong> food waste accounts for most of the waste</strong> we produce individually, Open Food Facts can play a critical role in helping to reduce waste and improving recycling, by:</p>

</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>providing detailed data about packaging for each product category</strong>: it would be valuable for public authorities, producers and consumers to know packaging used in specific categories (ex: milk).</li>
</ul>

<p>To do so, we need to have detailed packaging information of every product, including the shape (box, bottle), the material (PET plastic, glass,...), recycling instruction and (ideally) weight for each packaging element. Since 2012,<strong> it is possible to add packaging information in Open Food Facts</strong>, but we don&rsquo;t support the fine-grained packaging schema described above. Because of this lack of structured data, packaging information is currently rarely taken into account when computing Eco-Score in Open Food Facts.</p>
<p><strong>ADEME (the French environment agency) has decided to help us tackle this challenge</strong> by funding a project to create this new packaging data model, to improve packaging interfaces on mobile and web, and to organise the collection of detailed packaging information<strong> on the 10,000 most popular products in France</strong>!</p>
<h5>To collect this information, we will need the Open Food Facts community to help us promote packaging transparency.</h5>
<h5>More information about this operation will come soon, be sure to join us on <mark><a href="http://openfoodfacts.slack.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Slack</a></mark> (#packaging channel) if you&rsquo;re interested in this challenge! 🙋&zwj;♀️ 🙋 🙋&zwj;♂️ 🙋&zwj;♀️ 🙋 🙋&zwj;♂️ 🙋&zwj;♀️ 🙋 🙋&zwj;♂️</h5>
