<p><strong>Virginia:&nbsp;</strong>I have been <strong>paying attention to the waste my consumption generates</strong> for several years and this project gives me the opportunity to go further.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Not only do I pay attention to what I buy and how I throw it away, <strong>I can also contribute to sharing information, raising awareness and improving the waste management process</strong>, so I can act upstream in the end!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Didier</strong>: My motivation comes from the fact that before discovering Open Food Facts I was already doing personal comparison tables <strong>for dietetic purposes or for the problem of additives </strong>(I am a very old reader of <em>Que choisir</em>), and that I am also <strong>very interested in ecology</strong> and therefore the problem of packaging.</p>

<p><strong>Arnaud</strong>: During the day I collect the items and every evening I weigh them. It's a few products a day. <strong>You need to be regular in the process. </strong>Entering the barcode and going to the bottom of the page takes the most time.

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Didier</strong>: I don't know if the info is on the site but I use Wikipedia to convert the numerical codes of the recycling symbols to identify the plastics.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Virginia</strong>: Here's my own little organisation, when I come back from shopping I look at the pages of the new products before I put them away.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This way I can take a picture of the uneaten product if I need to; <strong>noting the labels, ingredients, makes me aware of what I'm going to consume.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Once the product is consumed, I only have to wash, weigh it and add the information from the packaging.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I really like this little ritual, first of all <strong>it has helped me understand how items are produced and marketed, and I feel much more responsible and in control of my consumption.</strong>Little by little <strong>I am changing my buying habits</strong>; I was amazed to realise that products I thought were environmentally friendly were not at all in fact, and I get a lot of satisfaction from f<strong>inding new alternative products that better fit my values</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Didier</strong>: The biggest problem is weighing, I only have a kitchen scale with a minimum of 1 g so I sometimes stack 6 or 8 yoghurt seals to reach 1 g and make a division.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Paul</strong>: If you want precision, it can be complicated because of the <strong>number of lines required </strong>(materials and also shapes). The shape can make the difference. Or the terms of the Triman. If there are 20, 30 + headings, one can get lost unrolling everything. Perhaps (?) <strong>the material could create a list of 'shapes'</strong> (cardboard = rarely bottle, rarely carton, and a case or box is rarely glass). If you click on "cardboard" you would then only have the cardboard shapes [e.g.], but plastic would also give bottles, flasks, jars. In glass you would have 'not too many shapes', in metal a number, in plastic more (very malleable (heat moldable), its primary use: taking all shapes).</p>

<p>I saw some too modern Reblochon (cheese) the other morning, with <strong>a QR-Code and no barcode</strong>. Not having a smartphone, I thought I wouldn't be able to put its data on the Open Food Facts site, and didn't buy it...

<p><strong>Virginia</strong>: I realised that the <strong>process could be a bit technical regarding packaging</strong>, there are many different shapes and materials of packaging, sometimes codes like for plastics, a little guide would be very useful!</p>
