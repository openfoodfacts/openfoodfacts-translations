In 2017, the number of products in the open, collaborative <a href="https://fr.openfoodfacts.org">Open Food Facts</a> database quadrupled <b>from 100,000 to 400,000 products.</b> In June 2018, we are now at 550,000 products. Thank you to all ! Thank you to all ! Thank you to all ! Thank you to all ! Thank you to all ! Thank you to all ! Thank you to all ! Thank you to all ! Thank you to all !<br>

<br>
<b>But the small dedicated server that we rent from the French host OVH is out of breath:</b> there is no more disk space available to store the pictures of new products (lists of ingredients, nutritional tables), and the server is regularly overloaded by requests from site visitors and more than 100 re-users of data from the database (ranging from scientists like Professor Hercberg's team at the origin of Nutri-Score to very diverse applications like Yuka used today by more than 3 million people).<br>
<br>
In order for the base to continue to grow, we must urgently move Open Food Facts to 1 or 2 more powerful servers with more disk space.<br>
<br>
<a href="https://www.helloasso.com/associations/open-food-facts/collectes/participez-a-l-hebergement-2018-2019-de-la-base-open-food-facts">So we launched a campaign on HelloAsso</a> to finance the rental of these servers.
