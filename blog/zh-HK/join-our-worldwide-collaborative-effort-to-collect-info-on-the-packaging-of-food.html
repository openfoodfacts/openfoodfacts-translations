<br />
The Eco-Score is also displayed on </a><a href="https://world.openfoodfacts.org">the Open Food Facts website</a> which makes it very easy to compare the ecoscore of products, to classify the products according to their Eco-Score, and to see the distribution of the environmental score for a product category, a brand, or a label.<br />

<br />
The Eco-Score is calculated on the basis of life cycle analyzes (LCA) from the Agribalyse environmental database of ADEME and INRAE ​​for 2,500 product categories. <br />
<br />
This score is modulated for each product according to their labels (organic, quality labels, etc.), their ingredients and their origins, and the materials used for their packaging.<br />

<b>The Eco-Score computation is made possible thanks to the tens of thousands of Open Food Facts contributors</b> who add photos and structure food product information.

<br />
The Eco-Score is calculated on the basis of life cycle analyzes (LCA) from the Agribalyse environmental database of ADEME and INRAE ​​for 2,500 product categories. <br />
<br />
This score is modulated for each product according to their labels (organic, quality labels, etc.), their ingredients and their origins, and the materials used for their packaging.<br />
<br />
<h3><b>A climate issue that requires the collaboration of all stakeholders and all citizens</b></h3>
The Eco-Score is supported by a group of 8 committed digital and food actors: <br />

We hope that the Eco-Score will be adopted by more and more players, and that like the Nutri-Score, it will soon appear on product packagings. Open Food Facts now makes the Eco-Score computation available for the more than 100 applications and services that use our database.

<b>The Eco-Score computation is made possible thanks to the tens of thousands of Open Food Facts contributors</b> who add photos and structure food product information. To precisely compute the Eco-Score, it is indeed necessary to have detailed information on the origin of the ingredients and the packaging materials. A big thank you in particular to all the committed citizens who participate in our big <a href="https://en.blog.openfoodfacts.org/news/join-our-worldwide-collaborative-effort-to-collect-info-on-the-packaging-of-food"> collaborative inventory of food product packaging&#160;!</a>&#160;<br />
<br />
<b> We also call on manufacturers to send us the information they already have </b> directly to us via our free platform for producers, in order to allow a more precise calculation of the Eco-Score. The platform will also allow them to obtain all the details of the Eco-Score calculation for all of their products. The platform will also allow them to obtain all the details of the Eco-Score calculation for all of their products. <br />
<br />
Today, <b>we have computed on Open Food Facts the Eco-score of more than 240,000 products</b> sold in France. <br />
<br />
Thanks to the collaboration of all involved food stakeholders, citizens, manufacturers and scientists, we will be able to improve the Eco-Score and collect increasingly precise data for more and more products. <br />
<br />
<b>This will make the Eco-Score a useful tool both for consumers to make more informed choices, and for manufacturers to reduce the&#160;</b><b>environmental&#160;</b><b>impact of their products on the market.</b><br />
