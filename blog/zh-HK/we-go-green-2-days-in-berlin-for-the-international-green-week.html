<p>For Open Food Facts, which is always on the go when it comes to meeting new players, this was the perfect opportunity to learn more about the food ecosystem in Germany. Last week, Raphaël (our Machine Learning engineer) and Manon (our international development officer) traveled by train to represent Open Food Facts and meet with hundreds of exhibiting producers.

<p>This fair is especially interesting because Open Food Facts is actively working to develop the project in its neighboring countries, especially in Germany.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Indeed, the German database is growing week by week with nearly <a href="https://de.openfoodfacts.org/">200,000 products</a>, over 3 million annual users and many volunteers, who are acting as pillars in our international expansion...Not to mention applications which reuse the data base, such as <a href="https://blog.openfoodfacts.org/en/news/using-open-food-facts-as-a-stock-tracking-app-in-germany">Smantry</a>, which shared its uses of the Open Food Facts database in <a href="https://blog.openfoodfacts.org/en/news/using-open-food-facts-as-a-stock-tracking-app-in-germany">this article</a> last month.</p>

<p>At the International Green Week, they met a lot of producers, mostly small ones (&lt; 50 references) of course, but producers who came from more than 100 different countries: Germans, Greeks, Brazilians, Peruvians, Uzbeks, Sri Lankans, etc....

<p>This fair was also an opportunity to meet many German institutional actors such as the BMEL (which would be an equivalent of the french Ministry of Food and Health); distributors such as REWE and, among others, several labels strongly established in Germany such as Demeter, Bioland, Naturland.&nbsp;</p>
