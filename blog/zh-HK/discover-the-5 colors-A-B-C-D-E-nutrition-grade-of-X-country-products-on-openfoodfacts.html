透過簡化營養標籤來幫助消費者選擇更健康的食物，法國國家營養及健康計畫 (PNNS) 的Serge Hercberg教授提出了《五色計分系統》。<br>
<br>
<img title="Nutritional note of color A" width="338" height="72" alt="Nutritional note of color A" src="https://blog.openfoodfacts.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/a_338x72.png"><br>
<br>
和能源標籤一樣，這個系統提供了由A到E的等級（由綠色到紅色按等級配色）。 . 這個系統是法國衛生部長圖雷娜（Marisol Touraine）健康法案的一部份（即將於2015年3月31日在法國國會進行辯論）。<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>More fruits and vegetables, protein and fiber, fewer calories, sugar, saturated fat and salt.</b><br>
<br>
<i>「每天五個水果和蔬菜」</i> , <i>"Less fat, less sweet, less salty"</i> : the notes of color try to synthesize these messages well known to the general public but not necessarily easy to apply when shopping .<br>
<br>
In order to establish a food score, a nutritional score is first calculated that takes into account the content of elements found to be nutritionally favorable (fruits and vegetables, protein and fiber) and elements considered to be unfavorable. energy, simple sugars, saturated fatty acids, and sodium corresponding to salt). 其中綠色、黃色、橙色、紫色和紅色 (A, B, C, D, E) 分別對應不同的營養價值。 <br>
<br>
<b>A note to compare foods when shopping</b><br>
<br>
和其他等級系統（例如每日建議攝取量）不同，這個分數獨立於廠商所標示的分量之外。由於不同廠商的標準有時會有很大出入，我們或會因而低估了自己所攝取的分量。<br>
不計算成份表上的分量可以令我們可以更加容易地比較不同產品的營養價值。<br>
<br>
<h3><b>Open Food Facts上的顏色標籤</b></h3>
我們在2014年9月聯絡了Hercberg教授，想要了解他在<a href="https://www.sante.gouv.fr/IMG/pdf/rapport_Hercberg_15_11_2013.pdf">《國家健康計劃：促進公眾健康之新提議》</a>中提出的五色計分系統的確實計算方法。<br>
<br>
Professor Hercberg's team sent us <a href="https://world-en.openfoodfacts.org/nutriscore">the calculation formula</a> and all the information needed to calculate the score and the nutritional score, so we were able to apply the formula to the products in the <a href="https://world.openfoodfacts.org">Open Food Facts</a> collaborative database. Scoring is possible for products for which a sufficiently complete nutrition table is shown on the packaging. To date, we have been able to determine the rating of more than 10,000 food products. 不過我們只能在廠商誠實地公開完整的營養表下才能計算其營養分數。 不過我們只能在廠商誠實地公開完整的營養表下才能計算其營養分數。 直至現時為止，我們已經為過萬款食品分級。<br>

In the minutes and hours following the broadcast of the report, Open Food Facts had its biggest peak of registrations and received many positive messages by e-mail and on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/openfoodfacts/">our Facebook group</a> . It is an enthusiasm that we have seen every time we present the Open Food Facts project to the general public and the implementation of the nutritional notes on the mobile application.

This enthusiasm is however far from being shared by representatives of the food industry such as the National Association of the Food Industry (ANIA) for whom the system of color notes is simplistic, stigmatizing products and making them feel guilty about them. 消費者。 消費者。<br>

<h3><b>The weight of words, the shock of data</b></h3>
Beyond the word battles, the Open Food Facts association aims at transparency and openness of data on food products. We are convinced that these data are data of public interest - they are too important to be kept closed - and that is why we started 3 years ago to build a collaborative, free and open database , in which more than 1,500 contributors added data from more than 35,000 products.

<br>
These data have very numerous applications: decryption of labels (additives, allergens, etc.), comparison and research of products, education ... a dozen reuses of Open Food Facts data have already been inventoried.<br>
<br>
This data can test, evaluate and refine a nutritional scoring system as a whole by applying it to 10,000 products rather than to weaker samples or focusing on emblematic but sometimes anecdotal examples.<br>
<br>
To this end, we have put in place a series of tools so that everyone can test the system of color notes of the National Nutrition and Health Program:<br>

On the other hand, the score is less useful for categories where all products have almost the same nutritional values as honeys that all obtain the D score. The system can then compare to similar categories such as <a href="https://world.openfoodfacts.org/category/spreads/nutrition-grades">spreads</a> The system can then compare to similar categories such as <a href="https://world.openfoodfacts.org/category/spreads/nutrition-grades">spreads</a> The system can then compare to similar categories such as <a href="https://world.openfoodfacts.org/category/spreads/nutrition-grades">spreads</a> The system can then compare to similar categories such as <a href="https://world.openfoodfacts.org/category/spreads/nutrition-grades">spreads</a> The system can then compare to similar categories such as <a href="https://world.openfoodfacts.org/category/spreads/nutrition-grades">spreads</a> The system can then compare to similar categories such as <a href="https://world.openfoodfacts.org/category/spreads/nutrition-grades">spreads</a> The system can then compare to similar categories such as <a href="https://world.openfoodfacts.org/category/spreads/nutrition-grades">spreads</a> <a href="https://world.openfoodfacts.org/category/pasta/nutrition-grades">意式麪</a> or <a href="https://world.openfoodfacts.org/category/jams/nutrition-grades">jams</a> or <a href="https://world.openfoodfacts.org/category/honeys/nutrition-grades">honey</a> .<br>

<h4><b>Nutritional notes of color in interactive charts</b></h4>
With a few clicks, the Open Food Facts search form allows you to create interactive charts that show all the products corresponding to certain criteria (for example category, brand, label ...) on 2 axes that you can choose (all nutrients, minerals, vitamins, number of additives, nutritional score etc.).<br>
It is now possible to also show the nutritional grade of color.<br>

<h3><b>From Citizen Data Collection to Citizen Science</b></h3>
We would like to thank the team of Professor Hercberg of the National Nutrition and Health Program who trusted us and gave us formulas for calculating nutritional scores and all the changes and adaptations made since September, and in particular Dr Chantal Julia who answered all our questions and requests for clarification.<br>
<br>
We are also very pleased to have been able to provide Professor Hercberg's team with our entire product database enriched with nutritional score. Product databases such as Nutrinet and Open Food Facts allow you to test and refine the calculation formulas and the different thresholds so that the nutritional notes are the most useful.

<a href="https://world.openfoodfacts.org"><br>Open Food Facts</a> is a citizen project from civil society (the entire project team and 1500 contributors are volunteers). We use <i>crowdsourcing</i> to gather food data from around the world. Projects like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</a> encyclopedia and the <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org">OpenStreetMap</a> collaborative and free map have shown that people around the world can come together to achieve great things. Wikipedia and OpenStreetMap are our models and we hope that Open Food Facts can also help improve the nutrition of everyone. We are therefore particularly happy to have had the opportunity to interact and collaborate with a scientific team. It is for us a first experience of <u>citizen science</u> that we intend to renew.<br>
