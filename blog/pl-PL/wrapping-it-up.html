You have probably already seen codes such as "EMB 56251e" or "EN 38.012.001 CE" on food labels and packaging. And you probably did not pay any attention to them. And yet, these codes - called "packager codes" for the first and "European sanitary stamps" for the second - can teach us a lot about the products we buy and eat!<br>
<br>

<h3><b><br>
A packaging code or sanitary stamp = a company</b></h3>
The packaging code identifies the company that packaged the food product. This may be the company that made the product, or the company that imported it and packed it.<br>
<br>
It must be mentioned when the name and address of the company that prepared the product is not clearly indicated on the packaging. Packaging codes are thus found on products where only the consumer service address of the brand is included.<br>
<br>
The European sanitary stamp or European sanitary approval number identifies the companies that produce or process animal and animal food products.<br>
<h3><b><br>
You can now in which commune the product is manufactured, transformed (or at least packed)</b></h3>
The first 2 digits of the code "EMB 56251e" identify the department, here 56, Morbihan.<br>
The next 3 digits identify the municipality where the company is located. But it is not the postal code, it is a number attributed to the commune by the INSEE. The number 251 of the french department of Morbihan is Theix.<br>

<br>
To these figures may be added a letter that differentiates food companies when several are established in the same municipality.<br>
<br>
The codes of the form "FR 38.012.001 CE" correspond to the European approval numbers. The first 2 letters identify the country. And we find the number of the department and the number of the town in the first 2 groups of numbers. The last digit group identifies the company.<br>
<br>
A great interest of the packager code or sanitary stamp is therefore to know which city a product comes from. This can be interesting <b>to focus on local products</b> and avoid products that must cross the whole of France. This also allows to see what types of products are manufactured in a municipality or department.<br>
<br>
Since today, you will find the town and the department next to the <a href="https://world.openfoodfacts.org/packager-codes">packager codes</a> on the <a href="https://world.openfoodfacts.org/">Open Food Facts</a> product sheets. Since today, you will find the town and the department next to the <a href="https://world.openfoodfacts.org/packager-codes">packager codes</a> on the <a href="https://world.openfoodfacts.org/">Open Food Facts</a> product sheets. (which makes it possible to check that the ham of "Aoste" brand is indeed packaged in Aoste (the small commune of Isère, not the capital of Val d'Aoste in Italy))<br>
<br>
Here is also the list of all <a href="https://world.openfoodfacts.org/cities">packaging cities</a> . Just click on a city name to see which products are packed there.<br>
<br>
<h3><b>See which products of different brands are manufactured in the same factory</b></h3>
Another very interesting use of <a href="https://world.openfoodfacts.org/packager-codes">packaging codes</a> is to cross-reference them across the entire <a href="https://world.openfoodfacts.org/">Open Food Facts product base</a> . It can be noted that some companies manufacture products for several brands.<br>
<br>
So our company in Theix code <a href="https://world.openfoodfacts.org/packager-code/emb-56251e">EMB 56251e</a> prepares as well <b>boxes of green beans for the D'Aucy brand as well as boxes of lentils prepared for Cora</b> .<br>
<br>
<a href="https://world.openfoodfacts.org/packager-code/emb-56251e"><img title="Products packaged by the same company" width="434" height="406" src="https://fr.blog.openfoodfacts.org/images/EMB56251E.png" alt="Products packaged by the same company" style="border:1px solid"></a><br>
<br>
Another example: a factory in Normandy in <a href="https://world.openfoodfacts.org/packager-code/fr-50-139-001-ce">Condé sur Vire</a> that produces Elle &amp; Vire cream and Carrefour half-salt butter.<br>
<br>
The fact that two similar products (for example, two boxes of lentils of different brands) are prepared or packaged in the same plant does not necessarily mean that the two products are identical. To make sure, you can compare the sheets of each product to check if the ingredients and the nutritional composition are also identical.<br>
<br>
<h3><b>So, let's wrap it up?</b></h3>
I hope that you will never look at these codes in the same way (or rather you will start to look at them!), And that together we will be able to make interesting and perhaps surprising discoveries as we identify all products packaged in different workshops and factories.<br>
<br>
The next time you add a product in the <a href="https://world.openfoodfacts.org">Open Food Facts</a> product database, do not forget to check if the packaging has a packaging code: it will be very useful!<br>
