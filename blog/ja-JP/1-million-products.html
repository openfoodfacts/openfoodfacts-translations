<h3>すべてのOpen Food Facts寄付者へ100万回の感謝を！</h3>
<p>Open Food Factsは現在、世界中で100万の食品を管理しています。 食品を寄付したり、写真撮影を行ったり、食品の情報を記してくださるなどして、2012 年に始まったOpen Food Facts プロジェクトに参加してくださった何万人もの人々に、心から感謝しています。</p>
<p>皆さんのおかげで、世界最大のオープンな食品データベースを構築することができました。</p>
<p>It is a citizen and collaborative database, because food is everyone's business - not just that of the agri-food industry and public authorities - and we can all be actors to bring more transparency.</p>
<p>It is a free, open and public database, because information on food products is of public interest and it thus must be public and freely reusable by everyone for all purposes: understanding labels and comparing products for consumers, but also scientific research, journalistic investigations, data-driven public policies, etc.</p>
<p>It is a non-profit, collaborative database, independent of the industry, to ensure that the general interest remains our only guide.
</p><p>It is an open base for all types of product information, in which we are adding more and more fields to more and more domains, so that it can address all the issues related to food such as those which impact on our health, the environment and society.</p>
<p>It is a global database, to address these issues globally, and to encourage the dissemination of best practices around the world.</p>
<p>Open Food Facts is a great example that any one of us can be a changemaker:</p>
<ul>
<li>with her or his own choices using the Open Food Facts mobile app or one of the many other applications that use our database.</li>
<li>by participating in the construction of a common good, adding products or completing information on Open Food Facts.</li>
</ul>
<p>Reaching 1 million products is a great success and a great reward for the efforts of each of us for the last 7 years. We can collectively be very proud of it. A million thanks to all of you who are involved in the project or supporting it!</p>
<p>Of course there is still a lot to do, and we need your help:</p>
<p>Open Food Facts アプリを使用して製品を追加し、データベースを拡大し続けるため。</p>
<p>To ensure the sustainability of the project, by making a donation to the Open Food Facts association to help us finance our actions in 2020.</p>
