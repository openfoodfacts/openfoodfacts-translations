<h1>За два дні вас чекає зустріч із понад 400 виробниками!? Це можливо завдяки SIAL!</h1>

<p>Вже понад 40 років торгова ярмарка SIAL (Salon International de l'Alimentation) – вважається однією з найбільших у світі подій у галузі харчової промисловості. Після чотирирічної перерви, зумовленою пандемією, SIAL повернувся з 15 по 19 жовтня 2022 року в Parc des Expositions de Paris Nord Villepinte.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Цього року Open Food Facts вперше вирішили відвідати цей ярмарок для взаємодії з виробниками продуктів харчування. І це, попри страйки транспорту - ось так ми були змотивовані💪</p>
<p>Кілька неймовірних цифр про SIAL </p>
<ul>
<li>240,000 кв. м виставкового простору (еквівалент 32 футбольних полів!)</li>
<li>7280 експонентів від 127 країн (серед яких 90% міжнародних)</li>
<li>265 000 фахівців та учасників</li>
</ul>

<h4><strong>Отож, чому ж Open Food Facts відвідали SIAL?</strong></h4>
<p>Наша основна мета протягом цих двох днів була взаємодія з міжнародними виробниками та виробництвами.</p>
<p>We consider that the awareness and development of the French Open Food Facts product database are now decent. To continue to increase our impact, we are therefore seeking to meet with food industry players in our neighbouring countries: Germany, Spain, Italy, etc., and thus establish our reputation in Europe as the food database referential. </p>
<p>There were no less than 800 Italian exhibitors at the show, so we were not disappointed with the trip! :-) </p>

<p>During these 2 days, we were particularly focused on meeting the exhibitors, but SIAL is also an opportunity to listen to conferences (SIAL Talks), to participate in culinary workshops or to discover culinary trends of 2030, among others.&nbsp;</p>

<h4><strong>What we take away from these two days&nbsp;</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Italian and Spanish producers were largely represented</li>
<li>More and more producers are putting environmental issues at the heart of their business (alternative products to meat, cereal-based milk, etc.)&nbsp;</li>
<li>The majority of French companies have recognised us and support our mission&nbsp;</li>
<li>The trend of food scanning applications is very specific to France. Very few international producers can name a scanning application.</li>
<li>The message carried by Open Food Facts is mostly welcomed by producers. And the only obstacle, occasionally encountered, is not related to the subject of transparency itself, but rather due to the lack of internal resources. </li>
</ul>

<p>We have taken this feedback on board and are aware that we have a role to play in easing the process of data sharing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A first step forward has been the writing of a <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/19eW3P1s1o95ksAns7k0qFdHqkJbL-Cs2/view?usp=sharing">practical guide</a> that allows professionals to get to grips with the Pro platform and import data in 30 minutes!</p>
<p>Beyond that, we continue to work on improving the <a href="https://world.pro.openfoodfacts.org/">Pro platform</a> to make it more functional and user-friendly. This will encourage even more producers to be more transparent.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are a producer and want to contribute to a more transparent food system, write to us at <a href="mailto:producers@openfoodfacts.org">producers@openfoodfacts.org</a>.</p>
<p>If you are a contributor, interested in discovering the world of food from the inside, and motivated by the idea of convincing more manufacturers to share their data, please contact us at <a href="mailto:producers@openfoodfacts.org">producers@openfoodfacts.org</a> or directly via Slack in the <a href="https://slack.openfoodfacts.org/">#producers channel</a>.&nbsp;</p>
