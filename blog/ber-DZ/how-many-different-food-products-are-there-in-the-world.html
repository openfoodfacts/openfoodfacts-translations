When I discovered the <a href="https://world-en.openfoodfacts.org">Open Food Facts</a> project, a friend asked me how many food products existed in the world. I do not know the answer, but we can have a rough estimate:<br>
<br>
There are companies such as DataMonitor that list all product launches, for example with the <a href="https://www.productscan.com/">Product Launch Analytics service</a> . Data undoubtedly very interesting, but whose access is unfortunately not free.<br>
<br>
The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) has released the global figures per year in this report: <a href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/Briefing/FoodMarketingSystem/new_product.htm">Food Marketing Systems in the US: New Products Introductions</a> .<br>
<br>
<br>
<img title="New food products" alt="New food products" width="350" height="350" src="https://fr.blog.openfoodfacts.org/images/nouveaux_produits_alimentaires.jpg"><br>
<b>In the United States, there are approximately 20,000 new food products each year. </b>The report does not say it, but there are probably as many that disappear from the shelves.<br>
<br>
We can probably multiply this figure by a factor to extend it to all 200 and some countries in the world. With a factor of 50, it would give <u>1 million new food products each year in the world</u> .<br>
<br>
<br>
The US report also gives the breakdown by category: <b>25% of these new products are sweets, chewing gums and snacks</b> . 20% ⵙⴳ ⵜⵉⵙⵙⵉ.<br>
<br>
Another report by <a href="https://crioc.be/">CRIOC</a> (Research and Information Center of Consumer Organizations in Belgium), <a href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/Briefing/FoodMarketingSystem/new_product.htm">New food products - January 2007</a> , is based on a sample of 412 new Belgian food products. The main categories of new products were sauces (15%), snack food / snacks (13%) and soups (11%).  <br>
<br>
It will be very interesting to compare these figures from one country to another, and to establish correlations with the prevalence of conditions such as obesity or diabetes and the number of new products in each category.<br>
<br>
<br>
If you know of other sources of information to refine this estimate of the number of food products in the world, thank you in advance for sharing it with everyone in the comments section.<br>
<br>
Do not hesitate to suggest other estimates, with other methods of calculation for example.<br>
<br>
<br>
Anyway, we have plenty of work ahead of us, and your help to find products from around the world on <a href="https://world-en.openfoodfacts.org">Open Food Facts</a> is very welcome!<br>
