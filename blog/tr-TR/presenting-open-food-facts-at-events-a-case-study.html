<h2>Presenting Open Food Facts at events: a case study</h2>

<p>2 weeks ago we participated in the <strong>Capitole du Libre</strong>, an event around free software, in the French city of Toulouse.</p>
<p>We came back enthusiastic about this experience, and in addition to telling you about it, we will try to encourage you to do the same! 🤓</p>

<h2>Our experience at the Capitole du Libre</h2>
<h3>Testimony of Gabriel, who presented Open Food Facts, during the Capitole du Libre</h3>
<p>"Leading event in the free software domain, the Capitole du Libre 2022 held on the 19th and 20th of November in Toulouse was a great success. It was a really great event on many aspects:&nbsp;</p>
<p>We had the chance to meet the French open source, open content and open data communities, to keep a booth presenting all the latest activity at Open Food Facts, and to give talks.</p>
<p>OpenStreetMap ve OSGeo arasında yer alan Open Food Facts standını burada bulurdunuz. All weekend long, many visitors came to our booth, reaching a total of about one hundred people by the end of the event.&nbsp;</p>

<p>At such an event, the public is always very friendly, motivated to know more about how they could potentially contribute to the project. We had prepared various posters, product packagings and QR Codes, in order to try our app, to participate in the donation campaign or to fill a form to get into the contributive community of Open Food Facts (you can read more about this <strong>Contributor Skill Pool</strong> in <a href="https://blog.openfoodfacts.org/en/news/join-a-team-of-open-food-facts-volunteers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this article</a>).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Every discussion we had was enjoyable and allowed to both identify the diverse profiles of the people interested in Open Food Facts and to make them discover the project, thus spreading once more the word about our open project.</p>
<p>Capitole du Libre, diğer çeşitli Açık Kaynak projeleriyle tanışmamı sağladı. Çalışmalarını ve bilgilerini paylaşan bu çok sayıda kendini adamış insanla tartışmak her zaman tatmin edici bir deneyimdir.</p>
<p>I was then given an opportunity to share my knowledge about Open Food Facts to around thirty people during a talk I gave on the theme <a href="https://cfp.capitoledulibre.org/cdl-2022/talk/HBHKE9/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">&ldquo;Artificial Intelligence for food transparency at Open Food Facts&rdquo;</a> (FR version). Bu konferans, teknik geçmişi olan veya olmayan genel olarak proje veya yapay zeka ile ilgilenen herkese hitap etti. After presenting the history of Open Food Facts, its objectives and its community, I presented on the way Robotoff works and its use of Machine Learning to improve the quality of the database.</p>

<p>I was asked several different questions after my talk, indicating to me that the audience had been interested by what they had heard.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, I was extremely pleased to participate in the Capitole du Libre 2022 for Open Food Facts !"</p>

<h3>Neden Open Food Facts'i tanıtmalıyım? 🤔</h3>
<h4>Open Food Facts relies on citizen crowdsourcing of data</h4>
<p><strong>25 000 contributors have added 2.6 million products</strong> to Open Food Facts. Veritabanında 100'den fazla ülkeden ürünler var ancak bunların büyük kısmı Fransa - Open Food Facts'in 2012'de başlatıldığı yer - ve bir miktar motive katılımcımızın bulunduğu İspanya, İngiltere, ABD ve Belçika gibi birkaç ülkeden geliyor. We would like this motivation to spread: we need to add products from your country and try to reach a critical mass of products. Daha da önemlisi, projenin güçlü yerel katılımcı toplulukları yaratması ve geliştirmesi gerekiyor.</p>
<h4>Yerel topluluklar oluşturma</h4>
<p>To create this community, we need people who can present Open Food Facts in front of as many different audiences as possible, from the most obvious to the most unlikely ones. Fransa'da projemizi sunmak için gelen tüm davetleri kabul ettik ve her seferinde sunumlarımıza katılan insanlarla hızlı bir şekilde bağlantı kurduk. Yemek, herkesin 🥗 ilgili olduğu evrensel bir ilgi konusudur. Etiketleri nasıl daha iyi anlayabileceğimizi, ürünleri nasıl kolayca karşılaştırabileceğimizi ve daha bilinçli gıda seçimleri yapabileceğimizi açıklamak her zaman çok fazla ilgi ve istek uyandırır.</p>

<h4>Nerede? 🏢 🏙 🏟 🏜</h4>
<p>Olası buluşma yeri ve izleyiciler için fikirler aşağıda verilmiştir, ancak sizin de kesinlikle başka düşünceleriniz olacaktır:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Open Data buluşmaları ve etkinlikleri</strong></li>
<li><strong>Ücretsiz yazılım / Açık kaynaklı buluşmalar ve etkinlikler</strong></li>
<li><strong>Yiyecek ve beslenme etkinlikleri</strong></li>
<li><strong>Okullar</strong></li>
</ul>
<h4>Open Food Facts'i sunmak çocuk oyuncağı 😉🍰</h4>
<p>We have ready-made LibreOffice, Powerpoint presentations you can translate and adapt into your language (if they've not yet been adapted). Ayrıca, çeşitli etkinliklerde Open Food Facts sunan insanların metinlerine ve videolarına sahibiz.</p>
<h4>Handling Q&amp;A after your presentation 🔎</h4>
<p>İnsanlar genellikle birçok soru soruyorlar çünkü tasarı ve sunumunuz düşündürücüdür. It's a good sign and nothing to be worried about:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tasarı ile ilgili sıkça sorulan soruları içeren bir sayfa var. It lists those that we get asked the most often.</li>
<li>If you don't know the question (which happens to all of us, promise!🤭), it's always possible to say: "I'm not sure, but I think that&hellip;", "I don't have the answer right now, but I'd be happy to get in touch after the talk when I've found out!"</li>
</ul>
<p>Get in touch to tell us where you could present by email or <a href="https://slack.openfoodfacts.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on Slack!</a></p>
<h4>Use the Presentation Kit to prepare for your event 🗂🤩</h4>
<p>Access and download the presentation kit (link below). If it's not translated, you may need to take some time to translate it into your language. It's rather short, and it's a good way to memorise the presentation 😏. However if you need help with translation, we have contributors ready to help out!</p>
<p>Please share with us your translated version (as it can serve to other contributors who wish to present).</p>
<p>Ask advice on Slack, as well as tips to print stickers and presentation material.</p>
