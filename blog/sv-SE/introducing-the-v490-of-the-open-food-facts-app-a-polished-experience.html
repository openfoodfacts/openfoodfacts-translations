<p>We've made it simpler and quicker to navigate through the app. You can now easily access your user lists of products under the "List" navigation tab. Moreover, we've renamed the "History" bottom item to "Lists", offering direct access to other user lists. Your Scan history is one of those lists.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Road to Scores is clearer</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On incomplete products, you will see a prominent card that tells you exactly what Open Food Facts needs to compute Nutri-Score, Eco-Score and ultra-processing level (NOVA). You now have the warranty that you’ll easily get answers quickly, even for incomplete products, given a little effort.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The app is more international &amp; accessible</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A step closer to making the app inclusive, we started a journey to improve our accessibility. We have also added many translations accross many languages.&nbsp;</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Strengthening the app for prime-time</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We had a <a href="https://www.france.tv/france-2/les-pouvoirs-extraordinaires-du-corps-humain/5026321-maux-de-ventre-depression-cancers-la-revolution-du-microbiote.html">TV appearance on French TV</a> on July 7th, and as a result, a lot of new users installed the apps. Slowdown of the server meant that it appeared as if Open Food Facts contained no products, and it was impossible to sign up for several hours. We’ve taken steps in the app to ensure that it doesn’t happen again server side, and that if it should happen, the messages are much clearer.</p>
