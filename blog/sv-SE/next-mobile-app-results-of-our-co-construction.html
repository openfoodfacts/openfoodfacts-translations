<p>Over the past several months, our community has been hard at work together, generating ideas, discussing them, giving our opinions through polls - all on the subject of the future of our mobile app.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The aim: <strong>how can the app help Open Food Facts have a bigger reach &amp; impact in promoting food transparency around the world</strong> ?</p>

<p>The first phase,<strong> brainstorming </strong>for new ideas, apart from being truly creative, with a <a href="https://excalidraw.com/#room=3bd7c53e64fa3466d8fb,6Z408c9GtISimWu95EzjQw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nice whiteboard</a>, was very encouraging. It was nice to meet people in a very different context who care about food transparency and the solutions it could bring to a large public. We held six creativity meetings but also got suggestions through other means.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The last part, <strong>grouping ideas in coherent tracks</strong> was quite challenging. After some hemming and hawing, and three sessions, we finally <strong>delineated 5 tracks to study</strong> in order to consolidate a possible roadmap.&nbsp;</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Then <strong>small groups carefully studied each track</strong>, this was tough work. We also organized a small <strong>user survey </strong>to have some more data to help ground the studies.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Asking the community&nbsp;</strong></h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Finally came <strong>the time of choice</strong>, where we asked the community about their preferences.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The results we present here are somewhat skewed as a lot of respondents are older, however, we <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RfW7gadVYMtK0ZruEutn9j-wOtBqaeDIqnzSwBFhvGM/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">studied if a regularisation on age</a> would change the results, but there are no significant changes, hence we kept original results. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The <strong>survey results</strong> per track are <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JVe1cgdSFJ10wKuoNYJVrHX9IvY4Fsup/view?usp=drive_link" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">available as a PDF</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We have to say it was really a tied match as most of the proposals were welcomed. This is an interesting signal that we have many possibilities. That said, for the near future, we had to choose one !&nbsp;</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The two most wanted tracks are “track 2 - <strong>personal mobile app</strong>” and “track 6 -<strong> improve current app</strong>”. To correspond to this, here is the short term roadmap we propose:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>we will work on a <strong>redesign of the product page layout</strong> to help users find what they are looking for more easily. It will also open the road to more customisation in the future.&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>we will try to make <strong>food preferences more accessible</strong> &amp; engaging. We will also support adding <strong>specific ingredients</strong> users want to avoid.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>we will add a <strong>quick scan mode</strong> to enter a set of products (for example the ones you just bought). Attention will be given to make it efficient to use.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>From that we will <strong>provide insights</strong> like for example the Nutri-score or Eco-score distribution. Helping people be more aware of their consumption.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>we will continue to improve the way information is displayed <strong>with education in mind</strong>.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In parallel, we are <strong>redesigning the search engine</strong> which will also improve experience in the mobile app.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We are thrilled to make these improvements and it has already started.</p>
