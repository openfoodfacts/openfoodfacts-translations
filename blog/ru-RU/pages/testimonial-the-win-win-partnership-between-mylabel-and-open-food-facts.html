<p>Today, we wanted to highlight one of the applications that re-use our data that we have had the pleasure of working with for several years: <a href="https://www.mylabel.io/?utm_source=article&amp;utm_medium=OFF">myLabel, the application that deciphers your food!</a> 👀</p>

<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td class="has-text-align-center" data-align="center">We started from the observation that consumers do not have access to the social and environmental impact of the food they consume. To give them the means to act on their consumption by taking these impacts into account, we evaluate products thanks to the analyses and expertise of associations and NGOs working for healthier and more sustainable food.<br>The evaluations are accessible in our free application and can be customised according to eco-responsible criteria: animal welfare, deforestation, biodiversity, climate impact, pesticides, working conditions, greenwashing and ethical practices or the fight against inequalities and fair pay… More than 20 criteria are analysed on nearly 1 million products.<br>Citizens can decipher products according to their values, by obtaining accessible information when they scan a product, and sort out what is greenwashing and what is real commitment of the brands.<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>myLabel allows associations and NGOs to increase their impact by giving them the means to reach consumers when they have a product in hand.<br></strong>&nbsp;<br>We have also worked with engineers from the Institut National de la Consommation and experts from CRÉDOC to personalise the nutritional deciphering of foods. Each user has the possibility, when he scans a product, to have a personalised nutritional indicator taking into account his sex, his age and the average portion consumed by the French. Each person can thus find a choice among their daily products thanks to nutritional information adapted to what they realistically consume and to their personalised needs.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td class="has-text-align-center" data-align="center">The starting point came from Christophe Hurbin, today president of myLabel, who had the chance, as a space engineer, to see the Earth "from space", with its riches and its fragilities, which left a lasting impression on him. Then he managed a very large factory in France where the challenge was to innovate on the environmental impact and working conditions. But these aspects were not visible to consumers, who made no difference to a competing product made under unacceptable conditions.<br><br>This is how the idea of myLabel was born: to make information and an evaluation of products according to social, environmental and health criteria available at the time of purchase. We have chosen to rely on trusted third parties that are trusted by consumers: a network of associations, NGOs and independent committed actors ready to share their expertise. After a pilot application with 1,000 test users, we launched myLabel in April 2019.<br><br>The aim of myLabel is to enable consumers - especially the most disadvantaged in terms of information or budget - to better understand the impact of their consumption on the environment and their well-being, and to find alternatives that are acceptable to them. We have written this desire into our company statutes and obtained ESUS (Entreprise Solidaire d'Utilité Sociale) approval.<br></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
