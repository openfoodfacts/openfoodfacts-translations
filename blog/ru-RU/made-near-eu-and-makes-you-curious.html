Leaving an exchange day devoted to data organized by <a href="https://www.inria.fr/">INRIA</a> and <a href="https://fing.org/">Fing</a> on the occasion of their partnership signing <a href="https://www.inria.fr/actualite/mediacenter/inria-et-la-fing-signent-un-partenariat">Prospective, digital sciences and society</a> , I asked Christian Quest of <a href="https://openstreetmap.fr">OpenStreetMap</a> what was the easiest way to integrate OSM maps into a site. It had been a while since the idea of ​​mapping products through their <a href="https://fr.blog.openfoodfacts.org/news/les-codes-emballeurs-vont-vous-emballer">packaging code</a> was making its way in my head. Between two subway stations Christian told me about <a href="https://leafletjs.com">LeafLet</a> , a very simple Javascript library to display a map that also has a <a href="https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet.markercluster/blob/master/README.md">clustering plugin</a> that allows you to easily zoom in a map to find points of interest (like the places where products are manufactured).<br>
<br>
The next day, <a href="http://madenear.me/">Made Near Me</a> was online, and as you can see with the number of tweets, facebook likes and +1, it received a warm welcome. :-)<br>
<br>
<a href="http://madenear.me/"><img title="Made near me" src="https://fr.blog.openfoodfacts.org/images/cestfabriquepresdechezvous_carte_logo.png" alt="Made near me" width="484" height="378"></a><br>
<br>
Two aspects of Made Near Me I particularly like:<br>
<br>
The first is that it's an example of reuse of data mainly from the crowdsourcing <b>of data</b> from Open Food Facts and Open Street Map. It is you and I who make this product manufacturing location map, and who can enrich it and improve it. This is what I like in collaborative projects: they show that between institutions and firms, a third way is possible.<br>
<br>
The second thing I like is the first feedback from people who are discovering the interactive map of "Made near me". They are surprised, and <b>they are asking questions</b> . The first thing everyone does is, of course, to look close to home precisely, to see what is made there. And we are often surprised by what we find:<br>
<ul>
    <li>The famous <a href="https://world.openfoodfacts.org/product/3256220881104">wild organic palm hearts</a> of Brunoy in Essonne. (origin Guyana)</li>
    <li><a href="https://world.openfoodfacts.org/product/3270190127093">Organic Mexican coffee</a> also "made" in Nice</li>
    <li><a href="https://world.openfoodfacts.org/product/3564700484296/crevettes-geantes-tigrees-de-madagascar-peche-ocean">Giant tiger prawns</a> from Ivry-sur-Seine (mutant shrimp because of the pollution of the Seine river? ;-)</li>
    <li>и т. д.</li>
</ul>
Of course this comes from the fact that the map shows the place of manufacture, processing, packaging and / or packaging of products, not the origin of the ingredients which are more rarely from a place "near you" .<br>
<br>
But suddenly <b>it makes you curious</b> , you want to know more. In addition to this "Made near me" map, we would like to have another map <b>"With ingredients from everywhere"</b> .<br>
<br>
This could give a map like this, but for each product:<br>

The more you look at the map, the more curious you become, and the more questions you ask yourself. Why is such a product made in such a place, with ingredients of such provenance?<br>
<br>
Claire de <a href="https://libertic.wordpress.com/">LiberTIC</a> said to me: "The MITI shrimps made right in the center of Nantes are thought-provoking :)".<br>
<br>
By searching a little bit more, we sometimes discover <a href="https://www.lesechos.fr/14/12/2005/LesEchos/19561-527-ECH_les-crevettes-de-miti-se-mangent-a-la-fourchette.htm">a big deal</a> . Our shrimps are in fact raised in Colombia, and cooked in Nantes. The creator of the company is a former researcher at <a href="https://wwz.ifremer.fr/atlantique">IFREMER</a> (one of whose centers is in Nantes) who spent 10 years studying shrimps and who found a way to keep them longer by spraying lactic ferments on their surface. The lactic ferments are listed in the list of ingredients, but reading the list does not allow to guess that they can keep shrimp prepared for 18 days.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Always more data, questions and answers</b><br>
<br>
And the more questions we ask, the more we would like to have answers. Which leads to wondering where we could find these answers. For some questions, we can find the answers by ourselves, by looking inside the cupboard and fridge or by going to the supermarket to scan some products and take pictures for example. For other questions such as the origin of the ingredients, it may be necessary to wait until it is stated on the labels (and of course preach that it is!).<br>
<br>
And questions bring other questions. Today the Ministry of Agriculture, Agro-Food and Forestry has published on its website alimentation.gouv.fr an article <a href="https://alimentation.gouv.fr/infos-origine-produits">"Origin of the products, what information for the consumer?"</a> <br>
<blockquote>
<div>"Consumers want precise information: for meat, nearly 80% of them want to find on the labels the whole life of the animal (as it is the case now with beef): its place of birth, but also breeding and slaughter. "</div>
</blockquote><br>
Perhaps even more than the origin, I would also like to know the nature of the meat. On the labels of prepared meals, the only thing that is specified is "beef" or "pork". But when we learn that the Findus lasagna meat was bought via Spanghero under the name of "frozen boneless beef ore from the EU (Romania)" and that the only criterion of choice seemed to be that of the lowest price, we would like to know a little more when we read the words "beef". <br>
