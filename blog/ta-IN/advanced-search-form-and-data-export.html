It provides access to a search form where you can specify many criteria to filter products and select only those that contain or do not contain a brand, a label, an origin, a packager code, an additive etc.<br>
<br>
You can also set limit values for each element of the nutritional composition: energy, protein, fat, carbohydrates, and all minerals and vitamins.<br>
<br>
You will also find at the end of this form <b>a button to download the data in csv format</b> . You can read this format in Excel, <a href="https://www.libreoffice.org/fr/">LibreOffice</a> Free Software, <a href="https://code.google.com/p/google-refine/">Open Refine,</a> and other software.<br>
<br>
That's the point of open data: they are available in formats that allow easy reuse of data. You can sort, aggregate, compare, and so on.<br>
<br>
If you see interesting things in the data, or if you spot errors, please let us know. :-)<br>
<br>
Technical details (which may be requested when opening the data by your software if it does not automatically recognize the format):<br>
- character encoding: UTF-8<br>
- separation of fields by tabs (tab)
