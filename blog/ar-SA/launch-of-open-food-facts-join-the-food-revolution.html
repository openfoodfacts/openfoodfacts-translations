<p>It's now been more than 6 months since we are working on <a href="https://fr.openfoodfacts.org">Open Food Facts</a> , a free and open database on food products. We planned to launch the site publicly in June, but we learned last week the existence of the <a href="https://foodrevolutionday.com/">Food Revolution Day</a> organized by the Jamie Oliver Foundation this Saturday, May 19, 2012. The <a href="https://foodrevolutionday.com/about-the-day.html">goals and means of Food Revolution Day</a> are so similar to those of Open Food Facts that we decided to move the launch forward to coincide with this day of the food revolution.</p>
<a href="https://foodrevolutionday.com/"><img title="" alt="" src="https://foodrevolutionday.com/assets/common/img/img-badge-728x90.png" style="border:0px solid"></a>  <blockquote><em> Food Revolution Day is a chance for people who love food; to their knowledge and highlight the world's food issues.  All around the globe, people will work together to make a difference. [..]  We want to inspire change in people 's food habits and to promote the mission for better food and education for everyone. </em> </blockquote>
<p>Open Food Facts is exactly this:</p>
<ul>
    <li>a collaborative project that brings together people interested in food who share their knowledge, talents and resources to create a free and open database on food products.</li>
    <li>a citizen project that can involve people from around the world to make a difference.</li>
    <li>a project that aims to help people change their eating habits, encourage manufacturers to offer better products, and participate in education and research on food.</li>
</ul>
<h2>A database of food products from around the world</h2>
<p>More and more information is available on food labels and packaging: from nature, to quantity or origin, lists of ingredients are now often completed by a list of allergens, and an ever-growing "Nutrition Facts" table. Labels (Red Label, Organic, Fair Trade etc.) are included. And we see other indications such as the carbon footprint.</p>
<p>But when shopping, who takes the time to flip packages, read labels, compare information? Who knows the list of 2000 food additives by heart (instead of the name of the additive, manufacturers often include a code like E330 for citric acid for example)? And who knows which additives to limit or avoid?</p>
<p>Open Food Facts aims to consolidate all this information today scattered over tens of thousands of packaging so that it is easily searchable and comparable.</p>
<h2>A database with multiple utilities</h2>
<h3>Helping you make better choices</h3>
<ul>
    <li>by deciphering the labels</li>
    <li>by comparing products and finding healthier alternatives</li>
    <li>by finding products that do not contain (or less) certain substances that we want to avoid: fats, salts, additives, allergens etc.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Encouraging Industry to offer healthier products</h3>
<ul>
    <li>rating products and publishing nutritional composition comparisons</li>
    <li>verifying claims such as "25% less sugar / salt / fat compared to other products in the category"</li>
</ul>
<h3>Help Research</h3>
<ul>
    <li>By cross-referencing data with other studies, researchers can try to establish correlations and try to link certain ingredients to certain diseases.</li>
    <li>for example, the average composition of products marketed in one country can be compared with those of other countries.</li>
</ul>
<h2>A free and open database</h2>
<p>Some of you may be familiar with other sites, services or software that have a similar product database. So why build a new one?</p>
<p>Almost all of these websites or services do not allow the free reproduction and reuse of their data. Their terms of use often explicitly prohibit any non-personal use and any extraction of some or all of the data. Even when they are public or semi-public, most organizations and companies that publish these services jealously guard their databases as a war chest that must not be shared in order to maintain a competitive advantage, or to make money out of it</p>
<p>We consider food information too useful to keep it in a safe, so we decided to do the exact opposite: we will not only allow, but also encourage, the reproduction and reuse of our database of food products, free by all and for any use, including commercial.</p>
<p>The previous paragraph spoke of several utilities for these data, but these are just the ones we have imagined. By making the data public, it is the brains around the world who will imagine uses and applications for this data that we probably would never have thought of!</p>
<p>The only two conditions for the reuse of data are attribution of paternity (mention that the data comes from Open Food Facts), and sharing on the same conditions (if you create a derivative work, you must also allow its reproduction and its reuse).</p>
<p>It's the same operating principle as the Wikipedia encyclopedia or other collaborative projects like <a href="https://openstreetmap.fr/">OpenStreetMap</a> : contributions are voluntary and unpaid, and the joint work is freely reproducible and reusable.</p>
<h2>A project where everyone is invited to participate</h2>
<p>When we talk about <i>open data</i> , we often think first of all about the release of data that governments and big companies already have. The French government has undertaken to open the data of the administrations on the portal <a href="https://www.data.gouv.fr/">data.gouv.fr.</a></p>
<p>Releasing the existing public data is good, but we can also take the problem from the other end and suggest to the interested individuals to collect the data themselves.</p>
<p>This is called <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crowdsourcing">crowdsourcing</a> (a term that could be translated as "open contributions"): a large number of people pool their creativity, their know-how, their time and their efforts to make great things possible. which would otherwise require years, or even decades or centuries. A very good example is the Wikipedia encyclopedia. Another less known is OpenStreetMap, which aims to create a detailed map of the world, free and freely reusable.</p>
<p>When I first evoked the idea of creating Open Street Maps, I was often told that it was a monumental job. I see it more like meticulous work. An ants work. From a lot of ants.</p>
<p>All the elements for the success of the project are indeed gathered:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Food information is available, it is included on the packaging.</li>
    <li>Technologies to collect them easily are accessible: mobile phones are more and more equipped with quality cameras and Internet access, and there are free and open source versions of excellent basic systems data, OCR, etc.</li>
    <li>More and more people are interested in what they eat and problems with food.</li>
</ul>
<p>Information, tools and people: we have all the ingredients! When it was decided to advance the launch on the day of the Food Revolution Day, the first contributors went to great lengths and in less than a week, the number of referenced products has almost doubled to reach today 700 products.</p>
<p>Of course, there are more than 700 food products in the world, but there are certainly many more food-conscious people around the world than food.</p>
<p>We invite you to join us: it only takes a few minutes to register and add a first product on the site.</p>
<p>More than just products, you can bring your enthusiasm and ideas to improve the site or imagine applications for the data. For example, you can send us your comments, ideas and suggestions on the <a href="https://openfoodfactsfr.uservoice.com/">Ideas Forum</a> or contact us by e-mail: contact@openfoodfacts.org</p>
<p>If you are interested in the project, you can also follow us on Facebook: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/openfoodfacts.fr">Open Food Facts in French</a> , <a href="https://www.facebook.com/openfoodfacts">Open Food Facts (International Version)</a> and Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/openfoodfactsfr">@OpenFoodFactsFr</a> (in French), <a href="https://twitter.com/openfoodfacts">@OpenFoodFacts</a> (in English).</p>
<p>International versions are under development and available on <a href="https://openfoodfacts.org">openfoodfacts.org</a> . If you want to help us out for the translation, we would be glad to!</p>
<p>By bringing the website launching forward and by doing in one week what we planned to do in three, there are certainly many imperfections. We hope that you will not hold it against us and that you will report it to us for correction.<br>
<br>
<a href="https://fr.openfoodfacts.org/qui-sommes-nous">A big thank you to the very first contributors</a> who made this project possible!</p>
<p>Thank you and Happy Food Revolution Day!<br>
