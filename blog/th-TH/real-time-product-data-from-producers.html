Manufacturers can now send real-time photos and data of their products from <a href="https://equadis.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Equadis</a> to <a href="https://world.openfoodfacts.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Open Food Facts</a>.

<h3>Always up-to-date data</h3>
<strong>Producers can send complete information on all their products</strong>, with a reduced risk of error, <strong>and most importantly, update them automatically in real time.</strong> This is very important because the composition of many products changes over time, for example when manufacturers improve recipes to remove additives, or improve the Nutri-Score.
<h3>Data useful to everyone, including manufacturers&nbsp;!</h3>
Sharing their product data with Open Food Facts via Equadis allows manufacturers to <strong>make their products visible on the Open Food Facts app and site</strong> (used each month by more than 2 million people), <strong>and on more than 100 apps and general or specialized services</strong> that use the Open Food Facts database. Data is also used by research teams, and having complete and up-to-date data greatly facilitates their work.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">The integration of data via Equadis also gives access to the free Open Food Facts platform for producers which also allows&nbsp;:</span>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>to indicate additional information</strong> (such as links to product details on the brand's website, contact details for consumer and sales departments)</li>
 	<li><strong>compute and check their Nutri-Score</strong>, the <strong>NOVA</strong> processing level<strong> and very soon the Eco-score</strong></li>
 	<li><strong>to identify opportunities for product improvement</strong> (for example, when possible, we propose reachable changes in composition to improve the Nutri-Score)</li>
