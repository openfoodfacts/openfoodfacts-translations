La nuova app Open Food Facts per decifrare meglio le etichette e partecipare al bene comune.

Dal 2012, <a href="https://world.openfoodfacts.org/open-food-facts-mobile-app">l'app Open Food Facts</a> permette di scansionare i prodotti alimentari, di decriptare le loro etichette e di partecipare alla costruzione del <a href="https://world.openfoodfacts.org/">il più grande database collaborativo, gratuito e aperto sui prodotti alimentari</a>.<br>
<br>
Ma in 7 anni l'app aveva preso un po' di polvere, quindi oggi siamo molto entusiasti di introdurre <a href="https://world.openfoodfacts.org/open-food-facts-mobile-app">le nuove app Open Food Facts per iPhone e Android</a>, e di dirti come puoi aiutarci a creare un'app ancora più utile con la nostra campagna di crowdfunding <a href="https://www.helloasso.com/associations/open-food-facts/collectes/une-meilleure-alimentation-pour-une-meilleure-sante-on-se-mobilise"><b>Una migliore alimentazione per una salute migliore: mobilizziamo!</b></a><br>

<h3>Novità?</h3>
<ul>
    <li><b>Continuous barcode scanning provides instant</b> <a href="https://world.openfoodfacts.org/nutriscore"><b>Nutri-Score</b></a> <b>and the NOVA group of ultra-processed products.</b> You can now scan several products in a shopping aisle without having to click a button. The time saved is very appreciable when you shop!</li>
    <div> </div>
    <li>If a product does not exist yet in the database, it can be added in less than a minute to get Nutri-Score and NOVA. It's useful for you, and it's also useful for the millions of other people who use Open Food Facts or one of over 150 other applications that use our database. Many thanks to all of you who add or help complete products!</li>
    <div> </div>
    <li><b>The offline mode allows to scan products and get their Nutri-Score and NOVA group without an Internet connection</b> . This is very convenient when you are in a store without network, and for all people who have a mobile plan without data (many among high school students). The offline mode is currently only available on iPhone.</li>
    <div> </div>
    <li>The app can <b>scan several products and compare them side by side</b> , to be able to choose when hesitating between a few products in a store.</li>
    <div> </div>
    <li>The app allows you to <b>create lists</b> and add products. This can be a shopping list, a list of what you eat, or lists to manage your stocked products (freezer, cellar, pantry etc.) and avoid waste. For now only on Android.</li>
</ul>
The iPhone and Android apps have been completely rewritten and are also more stable and faster. <br>

<h3>Collaborative and open source development</h3>
Many volunteer developers from all over the world participated in the development of all these novelties (a big thank you in particular to Aurélien, Prajwal, Fred, Divyansh, Subhanjan, Shubham, Ross, Karl, Branden, Prashant, Roger, Arnaud, Rudrank, Andrès, Manogna, Saumia, Nasia, Qian, Raphael, Naofumi, Lizzy, Dionysis, Pierre ... and all the others!).<br>
<br>
Many features have been added to the Android app by Huzaifa who was able to work for 2 months developing the application, during the Google Summer of Code 2018.<br>
<br>
And thanks to a grant from <a href="https://www.santepubliquefrance.fr/">Santé publique France (Public Health France)</a> and your donations on <a href="https://www.helloasso.com/associations/open-food-facts/collectes/aidez-open-food-facts-a-ameliorer-l-alimentation-de-tous">HelloAsso</a> and <a href="https://www.lilo.org/fr/open-food-facts/?utm_source=open-food-facts">Lilo</a> , we were also able to hire for a few weeks Philippe, a freelance developer who helped us a lot in particular to develop and finalize the iPhone app.<br>
<h3>Help us imagine and create an even more useful app!</h3>
The new Open Food Facts apps are available on the App Store and Google Play and are a big step forward from the previous version, but there's still a lot to do to make the app even more convenient and useful. .
<p><b>È in corso:</b></p>
<ul>
    <li>Migliora l'ergonomia in modo che l'app sia più intuitiva.</li>
    <li>Make collecting photos and information on new products easier and faster.</li>
    <li>Risolvere i bug.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>È previsto:</b></p>
<ul>
    <li>Detection of products that are suitable for vegetarians or vegans.</li>
    <li>Modalità offline su Android.</li>
    <li>Confronto dei prodotti su iPhone.</li>
    <li>Elenchi di prodotti su iPhone.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>E abbiamo molte altre idee, per esempio:</b></p>
<ul>
    <li>Consenti la sincronizzazione e il backup multi-dispositivo che rispetta la privacy.</li>
    <li>Integrare Open Beauty Facts in Open Food Facts per semplificare la scansione e il contributo dei cosmetici.</li>
    <li>Take the opportunity to merge also Open Pet Food Facts and Open Products Facts to really have a UNIVERSAL scanner :-)</li>
    <li>Post scientific recommendations on certain food categories. Did you know, for example, that sea salt does not contain iodine, and that it is recommended to consume iodized salt?</li>
    <li>View personalized tips or alerts on products, based on diet or dietary restrictions, as we already do for allergies.</li>
    <li>View health alerts and product recalls issued by your local authorities and their counterparts abroad.</li>
    <li>Add a system of recommendations of alternative products that is based on scientific criteria, which takes into account allergies, food prohibitions, availability in stores and offers alternatives that meet your criteria.</li>
    <li>To be able to have a summary of the products consumed during a period in visual form.</li>
    <li>A Dark Mode, because it will soon become the latest MUST-HAVE to scan at night in the fridge ;-) ;-)</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Hai altre idee?</b></p>
Could you tell us what you find most important and what features would be most useful to you?
<p><b>Partecipa allo sviluppo o al suo finanziamento!</b></p>
Il codice dell'app Open Food Facts è open source ed è su <a href="https://github.com/openfoodfacts">Github</a> : <a href="https://github.com/openfoodfacts/openfoodfacts-ios">iPhone (Swift)</a> , <a href="https://github.com/openfoodfacts/openfoodfacts-androidapp">Android (Java)</a><br>
Qualsiasi buona volontà di correggere bug e/o aggiungere nuove funzionalità è ovviamente benvenuta! Unisciti a noi sulla nostra <a href="https://slack.openfoodfacts.org">Slack</a> chat room (canali #ios e #android) per discutere l'app.<br>
<br>
La stragrande maggioranza del codice Open Food Facts è sviluppato da volontari, ma la loro disponibilità non può essere garantita.<br>
<br>
Being able to hire a dedicated developer, if only for a few weeks, can accelerate development much. This is particularly the case when it is necessary to tackle a redesign of a part of the code, or the development of a consequent functionality, and when it is necessary to solve the bugs which block the deployment of a new version . The hiring of Philippe in March and April thanks to the grant from Santé publique France (Public Health France) and your donations was really very useful.<br>
<br>
So today we are launching a campaign to fund future mobile app enhancements: <a href="https://www.helloasso.com/associations/open-food-facts/collectes/une-meilleure-alimentation-pour-une-meilleure-sante-on-se-mobilise"><b>A Better nutrition for a better health: let's mobilize!</b></a><b><br>
